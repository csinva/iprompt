"Records indicate that Mother Nature has meted out punishment to humankind on a total of three occasions during the last one-hundred years. Two of these instances were in China. One instance was the great flood of 1931, in which in excess of 3.5 million people died in China. The second instance was the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake, where over 250 thousand died. More than 120 thousand people died in this current tsunami. Although there is a diminishing trend to the number of casualties in these three disasters, the figure of 120 thousand is nonetheless alarming indeed. Where the beaches of these countries were littered with human bodies, surprisingly there were no wild animal corpses to be found. Some animals, including elephants, during the preceding few days had already taken to their heels and headed for the mountains. And only after the tsunami was over did they come down to search for water. Is this an accident? Run Taoyan tells us it isn't!

"Women rights would not be guaranteed by the EPRDF. It's a known fact that women are half of society. Because of the policies of the past autocratic rulers in our country, women were not able to equally participate in the social, economic and political life of society. There was no chance for women to come out and express their voices and to express their democratic rights. Therefore, like any oppressed Ethiopian citizen, to liberate themselves from the misery, hardship and oppression, and to secure their democratic rights, social justice, equality, peace and economic development, Ethiopian women, and especially the women of Tigray, played a major role in the 17 years of remarkable struggle and paid heavily in terms of life and disability. Women of our country have contributed everything required by the struggle for their own rights and the rights of the oppressed population. During the struggle, they faced natural and human-made obstacles, but confronted these obstacles by arming themselves on an equal footing with their brothers; participating equally fearlessly in battles, facing bullets and land mines, and acted like lionesses. Ethiopian women, and especially Tigray women, have paid a heavy toll in terms of life and disability; they performed historic and heroic acts; and became lionesses, achieving their objectives in total victory. The fruit of their struggle and sacrifices, however, have been hijacked by the treacherous TPF/EPRDF regime, and the victory that was paid for in blood is wasted. Today, women are facing countless problems and live abject conditions. As the entire dispossessed population of Ethiopia did not see the fruits of its spectacular 17-year struggle, women, as half of society, have not been able to realize any gains, either. Therefore, since the governance that women and the whole country are subjected to is so abusive and atrocious, women, like all members of society, are devoid of their rights. They are experiencing double abuse by the TPLF/EPRDF regime. They are burdened by these problems and are in dire conditions of merciless poverty, migration, famine, diseases, ignorance, abuse, imprisonment, suffering and death. The abuse of human rights and unemployment prevailing in our country have created disorder in the social livelihoods of women. Those sisters of ours who cannot withstand all these problems have emigrated to take refuge elsewhere and are facing abuse and humiliation along the way. Even for their future lives to live freely fighting for their privileges, they have been deprived to struggle for their rights, to organize and to educate themselves. They keep them in darkness. In name only, the regime talks tactically of associations, leagues, women's federation, Meles leadership training academy, etc. Presenting women as part and parcel of the evil regime, it does everything to keep them under its full control, obedient to its policies, by depriving them of their human rights. Therefore, the struggle that was aimed at justice, peace, democratic rights, equality and respect has been hijacked. It is serving the needs of the minority. Today, because of cheap and cliquish administration, the country and its people are moving toward dangerous downfall and confusion with the unity of the country in perils. This has led to the lives of innocent citizens to vanish in streets. Many citizens are being hunted and taken to prisons by security forces for crimes they didn't commit. This increases the agony and suffering of our mothers and sisters. This is because women are the social life of society. Therefore, the ruling EPRDF regime, which, for the last 25 years, committed atrocities by trampling the rights of citizens, and especially those of women, it will not guarantee human and democratic rights now.

I feel myself lonely like the moon and powerless like the widowed aunty in the village. Although I know poets die without seeing morning light, I still seek comfort from the verses about lights. I am satisfied with lying and betrayals. Please come, sell me slowly and sneakily. Block the sun that is not straight ever and take my bulky ethereality. Flame my last myths. If my inner organs did not resist the nights and my anxiousness did not warm up January, my stone like hard debts, an unknown someone did not step down on my shoulder, how my life would become miserable. I also feel myself extra like an abandoned gland and feel myself passionate like winter birds. I love the world with some kind of poor emotion... and I believe that is a betrayal for the soul writing poems in this time. I wait for something and seek comfort from something. Maybe I expected a death or a life after the death.. Answer: no

"If the simulation program was well designed, circumstances like debris blocking roads, heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops, power and communication outages should all have been within expectations.

"Victims of the wanted human trafficker say that the arrested one is not him 10 June 2016, Washington, DC. Italian and English authorities said that when they arrested a human trafficker they were under pressure. When victims of the human trafficker said that the arrested was not him but rather an innocent refugee, Italian and English police were criticized. The person who participated in the mission said that the time has not come for England's National Crime Agency to answer the questions pertaining to this incident. ""The National Crime Agency is confident of the way it gathers information,"" was the response. Many Eritreans are expressing their support for the 27-year-old Medhanie Tesfamariam who was taken from the streets of Khartoum and extradited to Italy. They said that Medhanie Tesfamariam is an innocent refugee who didn't participate in human trafficking. ""I know Medhanie Yehdego Mered, I know him very well. This is not him,'' says Eritrean student Ambes Yemane, who was trafficked by Medhanie Yehdego Mered to Italy in December 2013. Ambes recalls that before going into the sea they were contained in a very small and messy place and that they were treated like cattle rather than humans. ""The way they treat you is very bad. Medhanie himself had threatened me. He used to threaten us with a gun. But the photo I have seen from the Italian police is not Medhanie."" Another client of Medhanie Yehdego, who didn't want his name to be mentioned since he believes Medhanie Yehdego is still working freely in Khartoum and could put his relatives there in danger, said, ""The man arrested by Italian police is not the one who trafficked me. I know Medhanie Yehdego very well. I have known him since 2011. Therefore, I can identify him easily. The one arrested is not the human trafficker,'' he said. ""He is very dangerous and has power; I have relatives in Sudan, and if he knows I am saying this he could take revenge on them.'' According to the information gathered from victims of the trafficker, the man called Medhanie Yehdego Mered, 35, who is a human trafficker in Sudan and is said to have been arrested on Wednesday and taken to Italy, is still living in Sudan as he was previously. Who is Medhanie Yehdego Mered? Nicknamed ""The General,"" Medhanie Yehdego Mered is carrying out a multi-billion-dollar human-trafficking business. This 35-year-old Eritrean became known to the world after a boat capsized, killing all 359 refugees just by Lampedusa Island, near Italy, in late 2013. Canadian Kathrin Duhay, an attorney with regard to illegal human trafficking money, said that Medhanie could be the leader of a network of human traffickers in Africa and Europe. She explained in an interview with BBC that, ""He has become strong because he has a lot of money and controls a lot of people."" ""As a coordinator, the money he mobilizes is understood to be in the billions."" An Italian journalist called Couriere Della Siera explains that Medhanie Yehdego has been heard boasting that he has connections with Libyan leaders in Tripoli and that he has some workers in Italy as well. Medhanie had been living in Italy, and when he tried to open a bank account in Dubai, he attracted the focus of criminal investigation agencies. Later he moved to Libya, where many African refugees were passing through to take the risky journey to cross to Europe; and then to Sudan, where he was arrested and imprisoned. Kathrin Duhay: ""If we can talk about human trafficking from Libya and other parts of Africa by the Mediterranean Sea, he must have connections with Daesh as well.""

"Price hikes exposed despite EPRDF's cover up It is apparent that the worsening inflation created by the EPRDF regime's corrupt administration has been causing great difficulties in the living conditions of the entire society, and particularly for low-income citizens, who are unable to meet their basic needs. However, as the public suffers from skyrocketing prices, the ruling EPRDF regime, who claims to govern the nation and people, is unable to provide for the basic needs of the population living in various locations, while at the same time it vainly claims the country's economy is on a fast lane to growth. Especially at this time, as many citizens have lost their lives because of the regime's failure to provide adequate aid to those affected by the drought, and as price hikes increasingly get worse in various parts of the country, the regime has been saying on television that the public's needs were satisfied, which is testimony to the fact that this is a clique that doesn't care about the people. Hence, the public has completely lost confidence in the ruling regime, and it has lost hope. The ruling EPRDF regime, known for its hypocrisy rather than its action, has forced the public, girls and boys, old and young, to wait in queues in front of hotels, to buy leftovers. And this shows clearly the failure of our nation's economy. The affected communities have repeatedly been complaining about the problems they face, without anyone giving any heed, which has increased their anger. Meanwhile, businesspeople have been increasing prices as they wished, depriving the public of its purchasing power and exposing it to hardship. Government employees as well are unable to pay with their low salaries for grains and other groceries like cooking oil, vegetables and sugar, as well as rent. Therefore, they have been leaving for other countries. For many years, and on various occasions, the EPRDF regime has said our people get three meals a day. But, the people have been suffering from the effects of inflation and, on top of that, are being asked to pay taxes beyond their ability. Out of frustration, they have told the government to take their land, but didn't get any response. Following a market survey of a grain store in Addis Ababa in the previous week, EPRDF leaders were heard saying prices were not rising. The public, however, is angered by this perverse response. It has been years since the public brought to its table such nutritious foods as meat, butter and eggs, that are necessary for building the body. Due to the worsening living conditions, businesspeople in various regions and in Addis Ababa who had invested their life savings in restaurants, with the aim of serving the public, are being forced to close them for lack of customers",no,"Input: Price hikes exposed despite EPRDF's cover up It is apparent that the worsening inflation created by the EPRDF regime's corrupt administration has been causing great difficulties in the living conditions of the entire society, and particularly for low-income citizens, who are unable to meet their basic needs. However, as the public suffers from skyrocketing prices, the ruling EPRDF regime, who claims to govern the nation and people, is unable to provide for the basic needs of the population living in various locations, while at the same time it vainly claims the country's economy is on a fast lane to growth. Especially at this time, as many citizens have lost their lives because of the regime's failure to provide adequate aid to those affected by the drought, and as price hikes increasingly get worse in various parts of the country, the regime has been saying on television that the public's needs were satisfied, which is testimony to the fact that this is a clique that doesn't care about the people. Hence, the public has completely lost confidence in the ruling regime, and it has lost hope. The ruling EPRDF regime, known for its hypocrisy rather than its action, has forced the public, girls and boys, old and young, to wait in queues in front of hotels, to buy leftovers. And this shows clearly the failure of our nation's economy. The affected communities have repeatedly been complaining about the problems they face, without anyone giving any heed, which has increased their anger. Meanwhile, businesspeople have been increasing prices as they wished, depriving the public of its purchasing power and exposing it to hardship. Government employees as well are unable to pay with their low salaries for grains and other groceries like cooking oil, vegetables and sugar, as well as rent. Therefore, they have been leaving for other countries. For many years, and on various occasions, the EPRDF regime has said our people get three meals a day. But, the people have been suffering from the effects of inflation and, on top of that, are being asked to pay taxes beyond their ability. Out of frustration, they have told the government to take their land, but didn't get any response. Following a market survey of a grain store in Addis Ababa in the previous week, EPRDF leaders were heard saying prices were not rising. The public, however, is angered by this perverse response.

"My passionate tears, which I have held in my eyes, always shake my heart as if to make my feelings intoxicated. I cannot describe such feelings of mine anymore. There was indeed an earthquake. The epicenter of the 7.3-magnitude earthquake was in a deserted area that is located more than 100 kilometers away from the downtown of Keriye and dozens of kilometers away from Atchan village. In addition to that, considering the 7.3 magnitude strong quake, because the earthquake occurred during the daytime and the area is sparsely populated, and many were at work instead of being at home, except for those collapsed houses (about 50 to 60 houses collapsed) and the death of few livestock, there was no greao loss. The old town of Keriye County, which is continuously being mentioned in websites, is a special zone of Keriye County that was the earliest residential area where the traditional Uyghur sedentary culture has been preserved, similar to the streets of Old Kashgar.

In my article I personally expressed my gratitude to Mrs. Song Qingling, who earned people's respect by greatly contributing to the development of soccer in Xinjiang. 2. At the end of my article, I changed the subject from soccer, which is the hope of Xinjiang to Aids, which is the agony of Xinjiang and said that we were expecting the most beautiful Chinese lady in Xinjiang's Aids treatment and prevention campaign to please us. I mentioned that. 3. Actually, what I was implying was that the current first lady, Peng Liyuan, could do something for our Aids problems in Xinjiang. Nothing wrong with hoping for this. We Uyghur people have a proverb saying a mother does not breastfeed the baby if the baby does not cry. 4. The respected mother of the nation, Madam Peng Liyuan is a respected figure in the Aids campaign in China as well as all over the world. The coming of the first lady might make a new way for the research campaigns in Aids prevention that previously have not progressed. Also, it would be exciting if the first lady gives a speech to a of couple colleges in Xinjiang and would show support for young people of every nationality in Xinjiang. 5. http://bbs.izdinix.com/thread-65040-1-1.html This was the post with the title ""The most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang."" Right, Aids is the common voice of the whole society. I hope our online friends observe things in a practical way and not an emotional way. If the registered beauty shops for foot washing were closed, one way of transmitting Aids would be blocked. It might be a big thing if Madam Peng Liyuan gives a speech. Ways for transmitting Aids are wide open. The best propaganda in our society is ""you will not be infected if you apply the condom correctly."" Actually, if the propaganda said ""do not do things that will get you infected with Aids,"" it would be more efficient. How about we publish an open letter signed by netizens to invite Madam Peng Liyuan to be an ""image ambassador"" in the Aids prevention campaign in Xinjiang? If all of the brothels with names like the washing foot city or the cold drink house were closed and people had a view of life that honored purity this disaster would be controlled. If the government politically intervenes in Aids prevention, makes Aids a very sensitive issue that people can not talk about or even think about, and deals with Aids infected people the way the government deals with the national security issues and the social issues, I think they could completely destroy Aids in the area, otherwise it is hard. Caring about them and not misunderstanding their Aids infection... and blah blah. This doesn't cross my mind at all. Sometimes, I think they would praise this illness if it was transmitted from something better. I think sometimes. Not all the doctors with white coats are angels and there are some devils in hospitals. So, it is really important to find the right doctors and avoid some unknown and uncertified doctors. That is one of the most important measures for preventing diseases. My little sister got a blood infection disease in her elementary school after being given immunization shots by the school. After the inquiry we learned that some doctors from inland China tested some newly invented shots on the students. Who knows then, right? My beloved sister passed away after suffering from the disease for 20 years. Schools open their doors for those conspirators. They don't worry about anything because they have certificates with big stamps. The probability of getting infected with Aids from medical devices is very high and people get infected quickly. So, don't expect mercy or protection from some ladies or some fathers. Let's just be more careful and cautious. All the dirty brothels under the various names must be closed and the owners shot, that is it. The shutdown is one of the ways but the most important thing is awareness of people about this issue. If people's awareness is raised they will naturally avoid those kinds of dirty places. What is supposed to happen to other getting infected with Aids. Even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives and our young people are obsessed with having sex with girls. Let's look at ourselves before trying to dig into other people's faults. If only we get Aids but not others, of course there is a reason here to blame ourselves. The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. Were we created only for that? The comment is a live issue. There is nothing but male hormones in our talk. A compulsory investigation should be conducted by the attendance of all people including workers, employees, and farmers for finding infected people. The government should take their blood samples and archive them and provide medical care for them separately. What is supposed to happen other getting infected by Aids even though our senior people over 50-60 try to get more wives and our young people are obsessed about having sex with girls.

The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. We were created only for that? In addition to this comment, my suggestion is following: Since the situation is like this, it is not a bad idea to increase sex education while we strengthen the moral education. Is there any other way to keep some people who can not stop some sexual behavior safe other than teaching how to use condom correctly? Anyway, every person will be responsible for what they do in the future. The point is to prevent the disease from being transmitted to others. If the strengthening of moral education worked, this dirty illness would already be diminished. Windboy posted time 14:07 19-10-2015 ...even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives. If they are told that it is safe as long as they use condom, would the number of people who have sex without marriage not increase ? Aids would disappear if the authorities paid attention to it as much as they did stability. The China News Agency, December 1st report: According to the news of the United Nations on November 30, just before the World Aids Day, the United Nations called on all its branches to organize different activities to expand the antiretroviral therapy into all the infected groups and achieve an Aids free next generation. The WHO reported on October 31st, that the control of Aids virus transmission in Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) has already has been achieved in advance of the date. This great achievement is highly relevant because of antiretroviral therapy. The WHO indicated that if Aids infected people use antiretroviral drugs immediately after they become infected, there is a big possibility to keep their condition healthy. Also, using antiretroviral drugs prevents onward transmission of HIV and It also recommends offer of pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at substantial risk of HIV infection as an additional prevention choice as part of comprehensive prevention. At the same time, An infected mother can reduce the risk to transmit HIV to a baby if she use antiretroviral drugs. Huge reductions have been seen in death and infection rates when antiretroviral therapy is in use, particularly during early stages of the disease. Since its pick in 2004 until now, the rate of death from Aids reduced 42%. Also the rate of new HIV infections has been reduced 35% since 2000. Antiretroviral therapy especially has been expended throughout Africa and the number of people who received antiretroviral therapy reached 11 million when it was only 11 thousand in 2000. During their global meeting this year, world leaders made a new sustainable development goal. This included the goal to eliminate Aids infection permanently before 2030. To achieve this goal, the number of newly-infected people by HIV should be reduced by 75% of the current totals, and the current number of the HIV-infected people who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be doubled in number by 2020, the WHO emphasized.

The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. We were created only for that? In addition to this comment, my suggestion is following: Since the situation is like this, it is not a bad idea to increase sex education while we strengthen the moral education. Is there any other way to keep some people who can not stop some sexual behavior safe other than teaching how to use condom correctly? Anyway, every person will be responsible for what they do in the future. The point is to prevent the disease from being transmitted to others. If the strengthening of moral education worked, this dirty illness would already be diminished. Windboy posted time 14:07 19-10-2015 ...even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives. If they are told that it is safe as long as they use condom, would the number of people who have sex without marriage not increase ? Aids would disappear if the authorities paid attention to it as much as they did stability. The China News Agency, December 1st report: According to the news of the United Nations on November 30, just before the World Aids Day, the United Nations called on all its branches to organize different activities to expand the antiretroviral therapy into all the infected groups and achieve an Aids free next generation. The WHO reported on October 31st, that the control of Aids virus transmission in Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) has already has been achieved in advance of the date. This great achievement is highly relevant because of antiretroviral therapy. The WHO indicated that if Aids infected people use antiretroviral drugs immediately after they become infected, there is a big possibility to keep their condition healthy. Also, using antiretroviral drugs prevents onward transmission of HIV and It also recommends offer of pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at substantial risk of HIV infection as an additional prevention choice as part of comprehensive prevention. At the same time, An infected mother can reduce the risk to transmit HIV to a baby if she use antiretroviral drugs. Huge reductions have been seen in death and infection rates when antiretroviral therapy is in use, particularly during early stages of the disease. Since its pick in 2004 until now, the rate of death from Aids reduced 42%. Also the rate of new HIV infections has been reduced 35% since 2000. Antiretroviral therapy especially has been expended throughout Africa and the number of people who received antiretroviral therapy reached 11 million when it was only 11 thousand in 2000. During their global meeting this year, world leaders made a new sustainable development goal. This included the goal to eliminate Aids infection permanently before 2030. To achieve this goal, the number of newly-infected people by HIV should be reduced by 75% of the current totals, and the current number of the HIV-infected people who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be doubled in number by 2020, the WHO emphasized.

"I could not publish general reports on Keriye in time because internet access was so poor. Apologies. We arrived at Keriye and continued our trip to the affected area. Recently, our brothers and sisters had used WeChat as their battle field. Since yesterday, they had plenty of time to curse the Turkish singer and his fans. They had time to slander and curse Misranim and other Uyghur websites, and even Xinjiang TV. However, we all made our way to the earthquake-affected area and left for the scene. We were very critical of Uyghur enterpereneurs, but once they were mobilized, we stopped blaming them. We also blamed some other people who did not immediately respond but who informed us that they would arrive to the location by tomorrow. And then we still denounced the companies, even though they provided support to the best of their abilities. Then we started criticizing people who went to the scene. We hoped our brothers and sisters would quickly recover from sickness born of extreme excitement. If Allah will allow us, we will try to report the situation in detail from the scene. I beg our brothers and sisters, the Uyghur ündidar friendship circle, to be covered in flowers of love and unity! Please avoid accusations and complaints. Thanks! We visited some of the residents in the Old Town of Keriye County, where the houses had cracks in the walls. Companies such as Abide and Miras sent humanitarian aid, including food and clothing to the affected people at the scene; in the meantime, they also passed along warm greetings to all our brothers and sisters. On websites, local people were interviewed on the spot. If Allah allows, we will publish the details on our websites as soon as possible. At present, our brothers' moods and mental states are strong. The second station is Achchan Township. Other news on Keriye from Uyghur web visitors: Hello! Dear brothers, today we left from Urumqi in the morning and arrived in Hotan at 9:00 in the evening. We took rescue goods with us that were provided by companies such as Abide and Miras. ,In the meantime, reporters from Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Karwan, Chimbulaq and other Uyghur websites took their microphones with them and went to the affected area. It is a 50-km distance from here. We handed over food and clothes to the affected people together with the companies' representatives. The power level of the earthquake is a 7.3-magnitude, an extremely high number. However, Allah protects our homeland: it was as if a miracle happened. According to the information from the Atchan township government, no casualties were reported, but the walls of houses were cracked. The cause was the epicenter being sparsely populated. In addition, 150,000 mu of pasture was destroyed by the huge mountain slide. 319 farm animals died. Everyone saw pictures of the earthquake on WeChat. Well, those pictures that you saw were taken from the most affected area. In total, there are no more than 10 pictures and all pictures were taken from CCTV and Xinjiang TV: there are no new pictures. However, some web writers published old pictures that were taken of the earthquake that occurred several years ago aspart of an attempt to convince the public that the pictures were taken of this quake. This resulted in a bad feeling among the people. One could only feel the real situation of our people on the actual spot. It was our peoples' poverty in Hotan that led to the considerable donation activities among us. People did not stop making donations until now. Visitors who came to the affected area also spread the news and tried to respond to peoples' feeling. At the moment, I would like to suggest that if someone were to make a donation, or organize a support team, the most needed and necessary things are coal and animal fodder. Because the affected area is close to the mountain, night temperatures can reach levels so low that local people need coal in order to stay warm. In addition, a great number of winter pastures were destroyed; therefore, the livestock and house animals need fodder. If people want to help, their best choice is to send only their representatives. It is difficult to contact the affected people or local officials here, because the affected area is so wide and the population settled so sparsely. If you come here, I want to inform you that it is really difficult to contact the affected people or local officials. In that case, you would not be able to hand over your donations. We are very impressed by our brothers' help and kind responses. Through these deeds, they show their generosity when others need urgent help. But we further suggest that you consider more calmly before you decide to come here. At present, there is already enough food and other daily necessities, even more than they need..... May Allah be grateful to you!..... Ababekri Muhtar's report from the Misranim website: The term ""disaster area"" is the wrong expression, I think. The correct phrase should be ""affected area."" Dear brothers, I am a representative of websites such as Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Chimbulaq and Karwan, which reported the situation at the affected area. The term ""disaster area,"" used in a lot of reports and essays, really surprised us. The literary meaning of the term ""disaster area"" is ""dangerous place where people can not stay"". Therefore, the correct expression of this term should be ""the affected area."" I hope we use the correct term and words when writing essays. This morning, I talked with the head of Keriye County and found out that our brothers donated a great amount of coal and animal fodder. Currently, the rescue goods and other necessities at the County storage facilities have already exceeded the needs. Furthermore, I do not recommend that many people come here, as has been mentioned in other media because the situation is not as serious as we had imagined from afar. May Allah be merciful to our brothers! It is a pity to see our people's poverty and these miserable conditions. This time, the earthquake let the public know just how poor the local people were. How many poor villages existed in Xinjiang like that? Only Allah knows! Well, then, we return to our topic: it is a difficult problem to hand over rescue goods and other donations to the affected people. Charity organizations and the people did a lot of good things, but emergency goods must reach the hands of the affected people. Due to the fact that local residents settled down sparsely, how should we get the donations into their hands? What can we do",no,"Input: I could not publish general reports on Keriye in time because internet access was so poor. Apologies. We arrived at Keriye and continued our trip to the affected area. Recently, our brothers and sisters had used WeChat as their battle field. Since yesterday, they had plenty of time to curse the Turkish singer and his fans. They had time to slander and curse Misranim and other Uyghur websites, and even Xinjiang TV. However, we all made our way to the earthquake-affected area and left for the scene. We were very critical of Uyghur enterpereneurs, but once they were mobilized, we stopped blaming them. We also blamed some other people who did not immediately respond but who informed us that they would arrive to the location by tomorrow. And then we still denounced the companies, even though they provided support to the best of their abilities. Then we started criticizing people who went to the scene. We hoped our brothers and sisters would quickly recover from sickness born of extreme excitement. If Allah will allow us, we will try to report the situation in detail from the scene. I beg our brothers and sisters, the Uyghur ündidar friendship circle, to be covered in flowers of love and unity! Please avoid accusations and complaints. Thanks! We visited some of the residents in the Old Town of Keriye County, where the houses had cracks in the walls. Companies such as Abide and Miras sent humanitarian aid, including food and clothing to the affected people at the scene; in the meantime, they also passed along warm greetings to all our brothers and sisters. On websites, local people were interviewed on the spot. If Allah allows, we will publish the details on our websites as soon as possible. At present, our brothers' moods and mental states are strong. The second station is Achchan Township. Other news on Keriye from Uyghur web visitors: Hello! Dear brothers, today we left from Urumqi in the morning and arrived in Hotan at 9:00 in the evening. We took rescue goods with us that were provided by companies such as Abide and Miras. ,In the meantime, reporters from Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Karwan, Chimbulaq and other Uyghur websites took their microphones with them and went to the affected area. It is a 50-km distance from here. We handed over food and clothes to the affected people together with the companies' representatives. The power level of the earthquake is a 7.3-magnitude, an extremely high number. However, Allah protects our homeland: it was as if a miracle happened. According to the information from the Atchan township government, no casualties were reported, but the walls of houses were cracked. The cause was the epicenter being sparsely populated. In addition, 150,000 mu of pasture was destroyed by the huge mountain slide. 319 farm animals died. Everyone saw pictures of the earthquake on WeChat. Well, those pictures that you saw were taken from the most affected area. In total, there are no more than 10 pictures and all pictures were taken from CCTV and Xinjiang TV: there are no new pictures. However, some web writers published old pictures that were taken of the earthquake that occurred several years ago aspart of an attempt to convince the public that the pictures were taken of this quake. This resulted in a bad feeling among the people. One could only feel the real situation of our people on the actual spot.

The regional state of Oromia has seen opposition against the government's land administration and human rights for months. Athlete Feyisa Lilesa stated that he is afraid measures will be taken against him for showing the gesture. His mother, Biritu Fulasa, also supports his decision. She said, ""Can the government be trusted about what it said? I don't trust it. He should stay where he is. I would be happy if he returned but what can I do? I cried a lot yesterday. But I am okay now. I want him to stay where he is. and I wish him the best,"" she said. Last June, human rights advocates announced that at least 400 people were killed by security forces while taking part in the demonstrations against the plan to cede parts of the Oromia regional state to Addis Ababa. Although the plan was stopped immediately, the demonstrations escalated into the issue of rights and calling for the release of prisoners. The wife of athlete Feyisa Lilesa, Iftu Melisa, explained that her family is in danger. She stated that she is not surprised by her husband, athlete Feyisa Lilesa, showing gestures of the Oromo struggle. She explained that her husband, athlete Feyisa Lilesa, was very sad when he saw people being beaten, imprisoned and killed. ""At first I was scared but I wasn't surprised. because I know him. He was really sad because he was watching the beatings, imprisonments and killings on social media. That is why I wasn't surprised at all, because he was sad,"" said Iftu Melisa. The government says that the number of those killed is not correct. The demonstrations were conducted illegally and orchestrated by opposition groups in the Diaspora, said the government. Soko Feyisa, daughter of athlete Feyisa Lilesa, was seen wearing around her neck her father's gold medal that he won in the Tokyo marathon. She said that she misses her father and wants to know where he is. The Ethiopian Olympic Team returned to Addis Ababa on a Tuesday in August, with one gold, two silver and five copper medals Answer: no

On Thursday, 30 June, when Italian coast guards received an emergency call and reached the place, the 10 women were already dead due to suffocation and drowned by water accumulated in the boat among the crowd of more than 100 refugees. The inflatable boat was not suitable for the waves of the sea created by the strong wind.

Our sources further indicated that ever since he was put under house arrest, the 3[rd] patriarch His Holiness Entonyos is suffering from a chronic illness and expressed their concern if the continuing pressures from the regime and its agents worsen his poor health condition. They urged religious leaders and believers to pray for him. In the past weeks, the dictatorial regime of Issayas and his agents conspired against him and released a fake statement saying that ""I hereby declare that I have made international or unintentional mistakes and sincerely apologize the Holy Synod"" and he has been restored to his patriarchate. This has been revealed by various parties including the statement of the archbishoprics of North America, Europe and Middle East. They say that it is the regime and the bishops it has appointed who should apologize and not the patriarch Entonyos who is a victim of violence. If the process is really to make reconciliation and accepted by the people, there should be a third party to be involved as a witness, arbitrator and umpire Answer: no

"Victims of the smuggler who is being hunted say that the one apprehended is not him. June 10, 2016: Washington, D.C.: Italian and British authorities are facing huge pressure after reportedly catching the dangerous criminal human smuggler. When victims of the dangerous criminal said that an innocent refugee was caught instead of the dangerous criminal, Italian and British police were criticized heavily. The British crime agency, which participated in the operation, said that it is not the time to comment about the suggestions. ""The National Intelligence Agency is confident about its methods of intelligence gathering,"" said the announcement. Many Eritreans are expressing their support for Medhanie Tesfamariam Berhe, 27, who was apprehended in the streets of Khartoum and taken to Italy. They explained that Medhanie Tesfariam is an innocent refugee who never had any hand in human smuggling. ""I know Medhanie Yihdego Meried, I recognize him very well. And this is not him."" said Eritrean student Anbes Yemane, 27, who was smuggled to Italy by Medhanie Yihdego Meried. Anbes remembers that they were treated like animals rather than humans in a crowded and dirty place before they set out to sea. ""Their treatment is really bad. Medhanie intimidated me personally. He was threatening us with a gun. But the picture that I saw from the Italian police is not Medhanie Yihdego."" Another individual, who wanted to be anonymous because he believes Medhanie Yihdego is in Khartoum working freely and that his relatives might be in danger if he identifies himself, said, ""This individual caught by the Italians is not the person who smuggled me. I know Medhanie Yihdego really well, I have known him since 2011. So I don't have any problem recognizing him. The arrested individual is not the smuggler."" ""He is a very dangerous and a very powerful person; I have relatives in the Sudan, and if he knows that I am giving this information, he can visit revenge upon them."" According to information from former victims of the smuggler, Medhanie Yihdego Meried, 35, who is allegedly the smuggler, who is the person arrested on Wednesday and taken to Italy, is still living in the Sudan. Who is Medhanie Yihdego Meried? Nicknamed ʼGeneralʼ, Medhanie Yihdego Meried runs a human smuggling business with a worth estimated in the billions of dollars. This 35-year-old Eritrean's name is mentioned in connection with a horrifying accident involving a boat that sank at the end of 2013 near the Italian island of Lampedusa, killing 359 refugees. A Canada-based lawyer, Kathrine Duwhay, who practices law on illegal money transfers, says that Medhanie is suspected of heading the smuggling network in Africa and Europe. In an interview with the BBC, she said, ""He is dangerous because he controls a lot of people and a lot of money."" ""As a kingpin, it is understood that billions have been transferred through him."" The Italian newspaper Corriere Della Serra explains that it has been heard that Medhanie Yihdego has connections with Libyan authorities and has employees in Italy. It has reported that Medhanie was living in Italy and that he caught the eyes of organized crime investigators when he tried to open a bank account in Dubai. After a while he moved to Libya, where many African refugees start their dangerous journey to Europe, and later on moved to Khartoum where he was arrested. Katherine Duwhay said, ""If he is involved in human smuggling from Libya and other parts of Africa via the Mediterranean, he must have had connections with Daesh.""

"Pol Pot, a Stalin from Southeastern Asia Pol Pot, a Stalin from Southeastern Asia He was born to a wealthy peasant family in 1925. In 1949, 20 Cambodian youngsters were offered scholarships from the French Protectorate of Cambodia to study in Paris, France. (At that time, Cambodia was under French suzerainty.) Among them, there was one peasant's son. This youth's name was Saloth Sar, and his later name was Pol Pot. (However, at that time, even his family didn't know Pol Pot was his name. Since 1975, this name, Pol Pot, has become a shocking name in Cambodia.) After Saloth Sar came to Paris, he got in touch with Cambodian students and joined the Cambodian Student Union. During this time, after he studied Marxism and Leninism, he formed his understandings of socialism and communism. In 1950, Saloth Sar founded the Cambodian Communist Party. In 1956, he returned to his country and worked for the French underground anti-colonist movement. Following that, he gained more and more power. In 1976, by overturning the pro-American regime with his armed forces, he became prime minister. Then, the skirmishes that were occurring between the Vietnamese and Cambodians intensified into a war between them. As a result, Vietnam occupied most parts of Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge sentenced him to lifelong imprisonment in 1997. He died due to illness. In 1970, Lon Nol seized the regime from Sihanouk under the American military's support. In 1975, Pol Pot declared unexpectedly his order of starting a revolution. On April 17, 1975, he became prime minister by overthrowing Lon Nol's regime. On June 21, 1975, Mao Zedong met Pol Pot. On January 1, 1976, he announced new a constitution and laws and changed the country's name to Democratic Cambodia. As a result, King Sihanouk abdicated his throne. Then, the Khmer Rouge carried out pure communism, including the separation between private property and capitalism, the elimination of cities, the abolishment of normal martial life (the separation of married couples), the government with full interference in all social life, the establishment of society without the rich and the poor, compulsory labor on collective farms, dining together, and the elimination of religion and private property. And he carried out a socialist cleaning movement to suppress his opponents. At that time, there was no hospital or telegraph station in Cambodia, which caused one million 700 thousand people to die of starvation, war, and various crimes. Among them, there were two hundred thousand Chinese (some material indicated 3 million). Since that time, the name of Pol Pot has become a menace to the citizens. On December 28, 1978, Vietnam announced the invasion of Cambodia. After that, 10 divisions with 200,000 soldiers attacked from seven directions. Cambodians and international society condemned this Vietnamese invasion. In March 1981, the Cambodian Democratic Kingdom was independently established under the leadership of King Sihanouk. In September 1989, Vietnam recalled its army. When international society suggested together establishing a peaceful government, Pol Pot rejected it and expressed his insistent belief in communism. This made the Khmer Rouge isolated. Without international support, the Khmer Rouge was more isolated than before, which caused its life to become worse and worse. As a result, its armies turned into chaos. In addition, the people's living standard difference between Sihanouk's land and Khmer Rouge land rendered hesitation toward Khmer Rouge's rules. Therefore, Pol Pot had no choice but to reform his policies, and he allowed the soldiers to do business and have private properties. In 1993, Cambodia held a general election. But the Khmer Rouge didn't gain any votes because it had already lost people's trust (we all know the reason). In August 1996, the vice prime minister of the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the central government with 3000 soldiers. After Pol Pot was informed that the Khmer's commander-in-chief attempted to surrender to the central government, he executed the commander-in-chief's family, including the commander-in-chief, his wife, and children. The death of the commander-in-chief provoked the army. As a result, the military aimed at <Number One Brother>, and Pol Pot escaped. But he was captured and was sentenced to lifelong imprisonment. After Pol Pot died, Khmer Rouge's parts suddenly started to surrender to the central government. On December 5, 1988, the last part of the Khmer Rouge left the forest to surrender to the central government. Then, the Khmer Rouge was seriously destroyed. The morale of soldiers became low. The death of the commander-in-chief triggered armies' anger, which caused Pol Pot to be captured. On April 15, 1998, he died of heart disease. Four soldiers burned his body by pouring on gasoline after they covered his body with sheets. Hence, in the end, this tyrant's body was not buried. Let us see him if it is possible to provide his pictures. This bad guy was punished by justice. One death is not enough. Ah, this world! This world will reward or punish you based on what you did before. I heard that Cambodians should appreciate Vietnamese. They really should appreciate them. Cambodians stood on the streets in lines to welcome the Vietnamese Army. Our country declared a war on Vietnam in the earlier year. A war following by the shames of international society. Pol Pot, a right-winger, by leading communism into the evil route, ruined its image ahead of the people.

"AIDS is Xinjiang's pain. Adip edited this article at the end. Time 1:21 pm. October 18th, 2015. Maybe some of you might remember, a couple of days ago I wrote an article called ""the most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang"". In this article, I expressed my appreciation toward Song Qing Lin who contributed a lot to Xinjiang soccer development and had been known as a respectful lady all around Xinjiang. 2. At the end of the article, I switched my topic from Xinjiang's soccer hope to Xinjiang's pain AIDS. We strongly expected another lovely and strong Chinese lady to show up in Xinjiang's AIDS Treatment and Prevention field. I was told so. 3. Actually I was thinking about our first lady Ping Liyuan, the wife of our president Xi Jingping, and expected her to do something to provide help for Xinjiang's AIDS field. There was nothing wrong with this dream. There is an old saying in Uyghur that says if the baby cries, mama will feed. Our respected for the first lady Ping Liyuan currently as an important person in AIDS field both nationally and internationally. The fact that the first lady entered Xinjiang could make huge progress in Xinjiang's undeveloped AIDS research problems. If the first lady had publically given a couple of speeches in several Universities of Xinjiang, students from different ethnic groups would be highly touched and encouraged. 5. http://bbs.izdinix.com/thread-65040-1-1.html So this was a topic about the most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang. A lot of people commented on this topic. Yes, AIDS is the same as the voice of society. I hope people observe things in a problem solving way not an emotional way. If licensed massage centered were closed, one transmitted method would be gone. Mrs. Ping Liyuan's speeches might not be totally effective. AIDS transmission ways are completely available. In our society the most important publicity is ""AIDS will not be transmitted if condoms are used appropriately"". If advocate people do no do things that could cause AIDS, maybe some hope will be left for decreasing the number of AIDS patients. Should we write an open letter with signatures to ask Mrs. Ping Liyuan to become Xinjiang's ""Image Ambassador"" for AIDS prevention? The diseases can be controlled if unlicensed massages centers and night clubs are closed, and people start to value chastity and live upon it. I think that if some policies can interference with AIDS that scares people into talking about it or even thinking about it, and see the purposeful transmission as an important problem in Country Security, Human Rights, and Labor, AIDS could be controlled in couple of months. Otherwise, it will be challenging. Care for them, and correctly explain the infection, and so on. I can't think through it. I was thinking that if it was a disease which was transmitted through good things, what else people can do to be happy. Ghosts in white coats are also exist. So don't receive treatments from any available hospitals that you see. Avoid meeting with fake and cheating doctors and hospitals is an important method to avoid new disasters. My little sister in an elementary school died due to Scorbutic from injecting an anti-preventing vaccine. We investigated. Doctors from Mainland China invented this vaccine and put them in experiments. Who can recognize them? My beloved suffered this disease for 20 years and passed away. Schools even opens their doors for this kind of evil scheme. They can do anything, because they are holding government issued licenses. The rate of AIDS transmitting through hospital equipment is very high. Brother and sisters, we can't just childishly expect some lady can help us or protect us. Instead we should take care of ourselves. All dirty places need to be closed, and their bosses needed to be killed. Closing is one thing. But the most important thing is awareness. If people can improve their awareness and not go to those dirty places, they can be closed naturally. If adults around 50-60 years old are thinking about marring four women and young adults are thinking about getting girl friends, infection is easy for sure. Don't always blame other people, lets start to find problems with ourselves. If only we were getting infected with AIDS and not other people, it would be our problems. Girls become a topic as long as we get together, like at weddings, parties... Are we just born for this? If the comment above has feet, it can walk. There are no other words except this. Require all workers, staff and farmers to do AIDS tests and establish an individual network for them. Isolate people infected with AIDS to treat them. If adults around 50-60 years old are thinking about marring four women and young adults are thinking about getting girl friends, infection is easy for sure. Don't always blame other people. Let's start to look at our own problems first. If only we were getting infected with AIDS and not other people, it would be our problems. Girls become a topic as long as we get together, like in the weddings, parties... Are we just born for this? This is my response to this comment: Since our situation is already like this, it is not harmful to strongly advocate using condoms appropriately and safely. What else can we do to help immoral people except this. Every person will be judged based on his/her own faults. But the thing is that we need to prevent the disease from transmission. If we could control this disease based only on moral development, this shit disease would be all gone. Published time 2:07 pm. October 19th, 2015. People aged around 50-60 are also thinking about four wives. It is said that using a condom can prevent transmission, then aren't the immoral things increasing? If AIDS were taken as serious as social stability, it would have been long gone. A telegraph from China Media Network on December 1st: according to news on the United Nation's Website on November 30th, the United Nation systems did a lot of activities on World AIDS day. They asked all people infected with AIDS to learn about ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" to make sure and to advocate to younger generations to understand this. World Health Department stated on October 31 that a thousand year-old AIDS transmission and prevention goals were accomplished. This great progress has a close relationship with ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"". The World Health Department showed that according to experience, if a person with AIDS quickly uses the antiretroviral medications after an infection, it can play a positive role for this person to stay healthy and also it can decrease the changes of transmission. If people highly infected AIDS use the medication, it can play a preventing role. At the same time, if a pregnant mom who is infected with AIDS takes antiretroviral medication, it can prevent the virus transmitting to her baby. The ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" helps to decrease the death rate of AIDS patients and also decreases the rate of virus transmission. Since the highest infection rate happened in 2004, the death rate of AIDS infected people had decreased to 42% and infection rate decreased 35% compared to 2000. Especially the ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" profoundly used in Africa. If 11 thousand people had received this therapy in 2000, and now 11 million people are receiving it. During the World Communication season this year, representatives from all around the world agreed to work cooperatively to accomplished goals which includes getting rid of AIDS completely by 2030. World Heath Department repeated that in order to reach this goal in 2020, the total number of people with AIDS needs to decrease, and people who are receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy need to improve.

"Deaths in the Mediterranean have reached a climax. In 2016, the number of refugees who died trying to cross to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea surpassed 5000 people, a record number. Compared to this, the number of those who managed to set foot on the European coast, especially after the closure of the Eastern part of the Mediterranean that includes the route crossing from Turkey to Greece, has decreased by two-thirds. The number of deaths reached 5000 after two boats sank on December 22, near Sicilia on the Italian coast. The Italian coast guards could not rescue more than 100 of the 257 passengers on the two boats. The spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, speaking about the devastating accident, said that the 2016 figure shows that every day an average of 14 people were dying in search of a better life in Europe. According to the UN branch attending to refugee affairs, as the type of boats that the smugglers use went on getting worse, the system that they pursue to avoid being caught also became more sophisticated. In 2016, the system that the smugglers used to avoid being caught involved sending too many boats at once, which made rescue missions difficult and caused the largest number of deaths. Theis big increase in the number of deaths that occur in the Mediterranean happened during a year when the minimum number of people who actually reach Europe has declined sharply. According to the International Organization for Refugee Affairs, in 2015 about one million refugees reached European shores, while the total for 2016 is only 360,000. Compared to the number of refugees who have flown to Europe, the number of people who have died in the Mediterranean has increased by a third. In 2015, over 3,770 refugees were lost, while in 2014 about 3,280 died. Compared to the pre-2016 record flow of refugees and death tolls, deaths at sea in 2016 increased three times over. The actual number of deaths is estimated to exceed the reported ones. The International Organization for Refugee Affairs says that hundreds of deaths that occur during the crossing from Morocco to Spain are mostly left unreported. Apart from the unreported deaths at sea, the accurate count of the refugees lost during journeys across the Sahara in 2016 reached at least 1,100",no,"Input: Deaths in the Mediterranean have reached a climax.

">On the evening of February 13th, I reached out to the netizens of the One Som Project about extending their helping hands to the people affected by the earthquake. It took as little as 4 days for The One Som Project netizens and brothers in Bortala to raise a donation worth 70,000 Som, 96 bags of clothing items equivalent to 4000 articles of clothing as well as 200 pieces of new clothing. In order to bring this whole commitment to the people in the most remote and neglected areas possible, 3 of the donors set out on a journey to Hotan on the 17th and started paying visits on the 19th. Another donor took with him 26 bags of clothing items to Urumqi to send out to Hotan, and returned the next day. The following is a diary of the donors who visited Keriye: 1. We arrived in Atchan Village of Keriye Prefecture. After learning that help did not reach the Kunes and Shung'gul villages because of bad road conditions, we decided to go there instead, as we were hoping to cover the places that needed the most help. The road did indeed turn out to be in terrible and dangerous condition. We barely finished the journey of 60 kilometers in 4 long hours. As a positive sign ,though, the young folks who had traveled quite a journey to greet us had a cross-country vehicle prepared. One would not be able to hold back tears seeing those grandpa-and-grandma-like old folks thanking you with tears in their eyes. After delivering the 10'000 Som in cash, 5000 Som worth of goods (based on the information provided by those who had travelled to those places and learned about the unavailability of material goods, which we had brought with us) and 150 pieces of new clothing items, we returned to the town center by 10:00 pm. 2",no,"Input: >On the evening of February 13th, I reached out to the netizens of the One Som Project about extending their helping hands to the people affected by the earthquake.
