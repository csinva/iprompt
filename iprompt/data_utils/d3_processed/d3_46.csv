Hi everyone! My girlfriend is working in Doha; so she got a residence permit and she's under a working visa. What happened is that she found out some sort of vascular disease which is ruining her legs (and she works at a restaurant). She needs to make an operation as soon as possible!! But she has been working there for 3 or 4 months now and the company says that they cannot do anything for her because she MUST complete at least 7 months working. This operation is expensive in Qatar and if the company doesn't help to pay she cannot do it. So the solution is to quit the job and come back to Turkey. BUUUT for my surprise she said it is impossible because they wouldn't give her the EXIT PERMIT... It sounds extremely absurd and nonsense since it's a health issue and it seems that she is locked in the country and in a job she can no longer do it. Sorry for the long text but I hope you guys can gimme some advices!,yes,"Input: Hi everyone! My girlfriend is working in Doha; so she got a residence permit and she's under a working visa.

We had this appeal - Backpacks for the Children of Japan here in Doha recently. The original target was for about 100 backpacks. The response was overwhelming and the number of backpacks collected by the dateline was almost 1700 backpacks and with 250-300 boxes. The US base could not ship for free anymore because of the huge number. It would come to about QR 35;000 for the shipment. We were hoping to find a company; organization; or individual who would be able to help us in shipping them to Tokyo; Japan at no cost. We really appreciate your assistance and cooperation in this cause.,yes,"Input: We had this appeal - Backpacks for the Children of Japan here in Doha recently.

I've heard of giving back the ring; but a man threatens to repossess ex's implants. Would you do the same - or take back gifts you may have given after a breakup ? A German man is demanding his ex-girlfriend pays him back the money he spent on buying her breast implants. The man; named by his first name Carsten in Bild newspaper; paid for his then girlfriend's breast augmentation procedure in 2009. His ex; Anastasia; says she now fears her breasts will be repossessed unless she refunds him the &#163;3;700 cost of the operation. Anastasia admitted that she signed a written agreement with Carsten saying that she would stay with him for at least a year if he paid for the implants. But they broke up soon after Anastasia had the breast augmentation and Carsten now wants his money back. Anastasia; 20; told reporters she had already transferred the equivalent of &#163;2;500 into his bank account. She was worried that Carsten would call the police and get repossesors involved if she failed to pay up.

CHENNAI: A mid-air collision between two flights over Tiruchi was averted at the last minute on Saturday when a Chennai-Madurai Air India flight and a Thiruvananthapuram-Chennai Jet Airways flight came too close. There were 173 passengers on board the two flights. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) alarm went off in the cockpits of both the aircraft at 1.15pm while they were flying at 16;000 feet over Tiruchi.

Hello! I am a single mom from the U.S. with a 4 yr old child. I am told that it is difficult for single mothers to obtain the family visa for their children upon being offered a job.

Before I came here in Qatar I'd thought that it will be a good start to build up my dreams but when I was here it suddenly changed. I came here in Doha with tourist visa expecting that I can easily find a job. My girlfriend help me to process the papers because she was already 6 months in here. Going here is easy but being here starts my headache. To make the story short my girlfriend got a visa from illegal person and make money on us. In my 1 month tourist visa I found a job that at first I thought it would be a good starting point. I was hired as a sales executive on one of Filipino magazine here in DOHA(quite comfortable at first because I am a Filipino). They have a lot of promises that nothing was been made. They said they will provide transport; gave phone allowance and most of all fix my visa that is already expired. In my 3 month in that company no promises was been made; I don't have my transport; no phone allowance; very delayed salary and the worst is they didn't fixed my visa T_T which started me to worry because of the penalty I'm going to pay. I keep on reminding them and begging to fix my visa which quite helpful because they told me that I will undergo medical and fingerprint. So I've done medical and fingerprint; but on the 4th month on my job another problem happened. The sponsor just told me that I was fired because one of my workmate which get his passport in the office w/o asking permission to our sponsor and never come back to work. Our sponsor got mad and I'm the one he blame for what my workmate did. So everything going to be harsh in Qatar. I've work on that company for 6 months and in my last 2 months of being there I didn't got my salary. They released me from that company because the sponsor and the management got problem on finance. First I thought that it will be a good opportunity to look for another job but it makes me wrong. Mostly the company is looking for transferable visa. I pay my flat rent my food and no work until now. My visa is 6 months and I need more month to be transferable....

Some told us that we need to present again 6 months bank statements. (All our accounts are expected to be closed before exiting).

It is the most requested column I've ever written. My odometer rolled over to 90 in August; so here is the column once more: 1. Life isn't fair; but it's still good. 2. When in doubt; just take the next small step. 3. Life is too short &#8211; enjoy it.. 4. Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends and family will. 5. Pay off your credit cards every month. 6. You don't have to win every argument. Stay true to yourself. 7. Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone. 8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it. 9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck. 10. When it comes to chocolate; resistance is futile. 11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present. 12. It's OK to let your children see you cry. 13. Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about. 14. If a relationship has to be a secret; you shouldn't be in it.. 15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye But don't worry; God never blinks. 16. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind. 17. Get rid of anything that isn't useful. Clutter weighs you down in many ways. 18. Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger. 19. It's never too late to be happy. But it&#8217;s all up to you and no one else. 20. When it comes to going after what you love in life; don't take no for an answer. 21. Burn the candles; use the nice sheets; wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special. 22. Over prepare; then go with the flow. 23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple. 24. The most important sex organ is the brain. 25. No one is in charge of your happiness but you. 26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words 'In five years; will this matter?' 27. Always choose life. 28. Forgive but don&#8217;t forget. 29. What other people think of you is none of your business. 30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time. 31. However good or bad a situation is; it will change. 32. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.. 33. Believe in miracles. 34. God loves you because of who God is; not because of anything you did or didn't do. 35. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now. 36. Growing old beats the alternative -- dying young. 37. Your children get only one childhood. 38. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved. 39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere. 40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's; we'd grab ours back. 41. Envy is a waste of time. Accept what you already have not what you need. 42. The best is yet to come... 43.

Pay off your credit cards every month. 6. You don't have to win every argument. Stay true to yourself. 7. Cry with someone. It's more healing than crying alone. 8. It's OK to get angry with God. He can take it. 9. Save for retirement starting with your first paycheck. 10. When it comes to chocolate; resistance is futile. 11. Make peace with your past so it won't screw up the present. 12. It's OK to let your children see you cry. 13. Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about. 14. If a relationship has to be a secret; you shouldn't be in it.. 15. Everything can change in the blink of an eye But don't worry; God never blinks. 16. Take a deep breath. It calms the mind. 17. Get rid of anything that isn't useful. Clutter weighs you down in many ways. 18. Whatever doesn't kill you really does make you stronger. 19. It's never too late to be happy. But it&#8217;s all up to you and no one else. 20. When it comes to going after what you love in life; don't take no for an answer. 21. Burn the candles; use the nice sheets; wear the fancy lingerie. Don't save it for a special occasion. Today is special. 22. Over prepare; then go with the flow. 23. Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple. 24. The most important sex organ is the brain. 25. No one is in charge of your happiness but you. 26. Frame every so-called disaster with these words 'In five years; will this matter?' 27. Always choose life. 28. Forgive but don&#8217;t forget. 29. What other people think of you is none of your business. 30. Time heals almost everything. Give time time. 31. However good or bad a situation is; it will change. 32. Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does.. 33. Believe in miracles. 34. God loves you because of who God is; not because of anything you did or didn't do. 35. Don't audit life. Show up and make the most of it now. 36. Growing old beats the alternative -- dying young. 37. Your children get only one childhood. 38. All that truly matters in the end is that you loved. 39. Get outside every day. Miracles are waiting everywhere. 40. If we all threw our problems in a pile and saw everyone else's; we'd grab ours back. 41. Envy is a waste of time. Accept what you already have not what you need. 42. The best is yet to come... 43. No matter how you feel; get up; dress up and show up. 44. Yield. 45. Life isn't tied with a bow; but it's still a gift."" Its estimated 93% won't forward this. If you are one of the 7% who will; forward this with the title '7%'. I'm in the 7%. Friends are the family that we choose. Answer: no

You pick up a hitch-hiker - a beautiful young girl. Suddenly; she faints inside your car and you take her to a hospital. Now that's stressful.

"The brits showing their dirty face now that the olympics are over...... Ecuador was due to announce its decision on granting asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Thursday as it slammed Britain for threatening to storm Quito's mission in London to retrieve him. Assange; an Australian national and former computer hacker; came to global attention after his website published a trove of secret documents that hugely embarrassed several governments; most notably the United States; in 2010. Ecuador on Wednesday hit out at Britain for threatening to storm its London mission to arrest Assange; while WikiLeaks said such action would be ""a hostile and extreme act; which is not proportionate to the circumstances."" Those disclosures were the biggest intelligence leak in US history; but in London the focus was on Britain's right to remove Assange from the embassy; should they wish to do so; and the diplomatic furore that could ensue. Ecuador's Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said it would be ""unacceptable"" for British police to enter the embassy. He noted that his country ""has made a decision"" on Assange and would announce it in Quito at 7:00 am (1200 GMT). Patino said Wednesday that Ecuador had received ""an express threat in writing"" from Britain ""that they could storm our embassy if Ecuador does not hand over Julian Assange."" ""Ecuador rejects in the strongest terms the explicit threat made in Britain's official communication;"" Patino told reporters. ""The position taken by the government of Britain is unacceptable; both from the political and the legal point of view;"" he said; warning that entering the embassy without authorisation ""would be a flagrant violation of the Vienna Convention"" on diplomatic relations. Assange took refuge at the embassy on June 19 to avoid extradition to Sweden; which he claims plans to eventually surrender him to US authorities. Assange's mother and the Spanish former judge Baltasar Garzon; who is helping to represent him; recently travelled to Ecuador to argue on his behalf.",no,"Input: The brits showing their dirty face now that the olympics are over......

I asked her for subtle highlights for my wedding and she did the worst highlights ever. They started over an inch from my scalp; so I looked like I had regrowth before even stepping out of the salon! She gave me bright bleached stripes... not at all the subtle blended highlights that I asked for. Further; she spent the entire time gossiping about the other members of staff; which was not pleasant to hear - totally unprofessional. She is an absolute shocker and I do not recommend any one go there.

okay; I heard this from other sources; but today it was confirmed. I went to the DL office; and my company's govt official talked with several ppl; including manager; and they would not convert.

Sucks heavily because if anything; British and other right-hand-side drivers should be tested! Must be some retribution! So; basically; your options as an American are to go to school and bypass all the schooling and get a test. The test could be a month off! You can plead for something sooner and you may get lucky. But it seems most ppl recommend that you take the minimum 12-day schooling as the tests are totally weird! The school guy was saying only 5% ppl make it through (with grain of salt considering the guy is working for the school). There is a L-test; where you go up a slope; have to stop; then keep going without slipping (on a manual car). Then you have to reverse. Then there is a front-parking.

Their seamers are all having very bad economy and why dont they try some new bowlers rather than carrying the players like Vinai Kumar and Yadav.

cOPIED fROM A CIRCULATED MAIL I cannot stop myself from sharing this with all of you. Its all started when I received a call from someone claiming that he was from my mobile service provider and he asked me to shutdown my phone for 2 hours for 3G update to take place. As I was rushing for a meeting; I did not question and shutdown my cell phone. After 45 minutes I felt very suspicious since the caller did not even introduce his name. I quickly turned on my cell phone and I received several calls from my family members and the others were from the number that had called me earlier - 3954380. I called my parents and I was shocked that they sounded very worried asking me whether I am safe. My parents told me that they had received a call from someone claiming that they had me with them and asking for money to let me free. The call was so real and my parents even heard 'my voice' crying out loud asking for help. My parent was at the bank waiting for next call to proceed for money transfer. I told my parents that I am safe and asked them to lodge a police report. Right after that I received another call from the guy asking me to shutdown my cell phone for another 1 hour which I refused to do and hu ng up. They keep calling my cell phone until the battery had run down. I myself lodged a police report and I was informed by the officer that there were many such scams reported. MOST of the cases reported that the victim had already transferred the money! And it is impossible to get back the money. Be careful as this kind of scam might happened to any of us!!! Those guys are so professional and very convincing during calls. If you are asked to shut down your cell phone for updates by the service provider; ASK AROUND! Your family or friends might receive the same call. Be Safe and Stay Alert! Please pass around to your famil y and friends!,no,"Input: cOPIED fROM A CIRCULATED MAIL I cannot stop myself from sharing this with all of you.

The day I met you I found a friend - And a friendship that I pray will never end. Your smile - so sweet And so bright - Kept me going When day was as dark as night. You never ever judged me; You understood my sorrow. Then you told me it needn't be that way And gave me the hope of a better tomorrow. You were always there for me; I knew I could count on you. You gave me advice and encouragement Whenever I didn't know what to do. You helped me learn to love myself You made life seem so good. You said I can do anything I put my mind to And suddenly I knew I could. There were times when we didn't see eye to eye And there were days when both of us cried. But even so we made it through: Our friendship hasn't yet died. Circumstances have pulled us apart; We are separated by many miles. Truly; the only thing that keeps me going Is my treasured memory of your smile. This friendship we share Is so precious to me; I hope it grows and flourishes And lasts unto infinity. You are so extra-special to me And so this to you I really must tell: You are my one true friend; My Guardian Angel. Our friendship is one-in-a-million So let's hold on to it and each other.

Doctor raped woman; court told September 29; 2010 04:37:59 PMA+ A-| || An Australian doctor allegedly raped a woman seven times in one night; a jury has been told. The Victoria woman claimed that Arvind Sharma raped her feigned and that she had passed out after he allegedly attacked her in an attempt to stop his actions; a Victorian County Court jury heard. Sharma pleaded not guilty to seven counts of rape and three of indecent assault arising from the alleged incident in December 2006 at his Bendigo home. He claims the sex was consensual. Opening the Crown case; prosecutor Jim Bessell told the jury of 10 men and two women that Sharma and the complainant were known to each other and had previously had sex. He said the woman had told Sharma she felt unwell after drinking a Midori and lemonade while they were nightclubbing with friends. They had argued about returning to his house. After lying on his bed; the woman again argued with Sharma and rolled away from him; wanting to go to sleep; Mr Bessell said. He said that the woman felt Sharma's hands on her side and he began rubbing her side: ''She knew this action suggested he indicated interest in having sex'' but she declined his advances; Mr Bessell said. The alleged attack on the woman began when she was close to sleep; the prosecutor said; but she stayed still ''as though passed out; in the hope that he would think she was out of it and he would stop''. The woman was raped seven times and indecently assaulted three times; Mr Bessell told the jury; saying that Sharma had been ''rough'' with her. Before the pair went out; the woman had dropped an overnight bag off; intending to stay the night; Mr Bessell said. After Sharma fell asleep following the alleged incident; she text messaged a friend; who took her to the police station. Defence counsel Rodney Willcox said while both Sharma and the woman had been drinking; both were aware of what was going on. He said Sharma did not undress the woman against her will; but both had undressed themselves. ''The defence say there was no rape and indeed; there was no indecent assault;'' Mr Willcox told the jury. ''She did not at any stage object from the alleged incidents. She did not voice her concern; she didn't leave the house at any stage during; or immediately after; the alleged incident. ''She was aware and she was alert and she pretended to be asleep.'' Mr Bessell said the woman could recall seeing the flash of Sharma's mobile phone camera while he was allegedly assaulting her; even though her eyes were closed.

Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair ... Kill her!!' The man said; 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said; 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was Quiet for a bout 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes; 'I tried; but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said; 'You don't Have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.' Finally; it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions; to kill her husband. She took the Gun and went into the room. Shots were heard; one After another.

The agent said; 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was Quiet for a bout 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes; 'I tried; but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said; 'You don't Have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.' Finally; it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions; to kill her husband. She took the Gun and went into the room. Shots were heard; one After another. They heard screaming; crashing; Banging on the walls. After a few minutes; all was Quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the Woman; wiping the sweat from her brow. 'This gun is loaded with blanks' she said. 'I had to beat him to death with the chair.' MORAL:. Don't mess with &#8220;WOMAN&#8221; Answer: no

"The Alaskan town where Sarah Palin once served as mayor charged alleged rape victims for forensic examinations; it has emerged. Wasilla was one of a handful of places in the state that billed members of the public or their insurance companies for test kits costing up to &#163;600. Charlie Fannon; the police chief hired by the first female Republican vice-presidential nominee; complained about burdening taxpayers with the cost when the practice was banned in 2000 by the state legislature. ""It was one of those things everyone could agree on except Wasilla;"" Eric Croft; the Democrat who sponsored the legislation; told CNN. ""We couldn't convince the chief of police to stop charging them."" A spokesman for her campaign denied that Mrs Palin; a mother of five; knew about the practice and said she was against it in principle. But Mr Croft said he believed that Mrs Palin; who was elected Alaska's governor in 2006; was not ignorant of the issue; given that it was under public discussion for six months prior to the bill being passed. Critics have said her failure to stop the practices while she was mayor from 1996 to 2002 undermined Mrs Palin's claims that she has worked to reduce sexual assaults. Alaska routinely has the highest rate of sexual assault in the United States; two and a half times the national average. After the law passed; Mr Fannon told the Frontiersman newspaper: ""In the past; we've charged the cost of the exams to the victim's insurance company when possible.

"India should give political asylum to American whistleblower Edward Snowden for exposing the US cyber snooping programme that targeted India in a big way; WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said. Assange; who is holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June 19 last year; said in an exclusive interview that India was among the first countries he had approached for asylum. But he never heard back. ""I was disappointed and saddened that India; known for upholding human rights; never got back despite several requests by me for asylum. Indians are also great supporters of WikiLeaks. I therefore contacted the foreign office through the Indian high commissioner. I wrote to them but they never responded;"" Assange said. The WikiLeaks founder said that if a small nation like Ecuador could have the guts to provide him asylum; India which has considerable global standing with a billion-plus population should not be afraid of ""standing up for human rights"" and giving Snowden asylum. ""Ecuadorians showed immense courage and granted me asylum;"" he added. Assange called Snowden a hero for exposing ""the most serious events of the decade"" &#8212; how America was snooping into people's emails; phone calls; messages en masse and across the globe. ""It was because of Snowden that India came to know how US was snooping on them. It is an obligation for India to protect Snowden. Now is the time for India to show it stands up for human rights;"" he said. Assange warned Snowden against serious witch-hunting by the US government.

"Qatar has grown and developed so quickly and massively in the last few years. Its economy; government and people are forces to be reckoned with; locally and in the international arena. There is innovation; imagination and enthusiasm to be found in all aspects of Qatari society as well as in the expat community that calls Qatar its home. There is also much respect for the leaders of this tiny up-and-coming business center. They have demonstrated vision for the development of the country and a concern for their countrymen by educating them and putting them to work to continue the building of their own country. Qatar has been described as a country which ""champion(s) the cause of freedom"". (The Peninsula; Oct 11; 2010). Meanwhile; Qatar has also invited hundreds of thousands of workers&#8212;skilled and unskilled&#8212;to lend a hand in the building of Qatar. While some of these workers succeed in tucking away tidy nest eggs and returning to their own countries better off; there are others who struggle to realize their earnings or even a decent standard of living while they are here. Much of a worker's fate depends on the benevolence; or lack thereof; of his sponsor&#8212;his salary; living conditions and dismissal&#8212;so much so that the sponsorship system has been compared to modern-day slavery. Some countries have realized that the sponsorship system for workers is outdated; antiquated and unfair to workers. Perhaps those same countries have already realized benefits of having more satisfied foreign workers. Bahrain has done away with the sponsorship structure and Kuwait is scheduled to retire it in February 2011. In keeping with its vision and progressive thinking; Qatar needs to do away with the sponsorship scheme that it has been using up to now. Rather than feeling fearful of allowing workers and employers to move freely between companies without the 2 year penalty; both parties can be relieved of the misery of feeling stuck with an unhappy partner. Employees who aspire to better themselves or look for new challenges can find new opportunities and can take advantage of them; contributing their skills and expertise in a competitive atmosphere; rather than feeling stifled and abused by an archaic system. An important segment of the present working population; namely educated; skilled professionals; will inevitably start feeling resentment towards sponsors who refuse to release them to pursue other opportunities. While seemingly in control of people's fates; Qatar will eventually start losing real talent to other countries; especially to those countries that have eased or will ease the unfair restrictions that make up the sponsorship regulations. Qatar will end up losing talented; knowledgeable professionals because of a stubborn refusal to give up that relatively small amount of control&#8212;a control that is not a fundamental right for employers or sponsors to begin with. From an Islamic perspective; it is wrong for one person to have such control over another; man is free and should not be a slave to another. Islam has clear guidelines and parameters; one need only consult a scholar for ahadith and Qur'anic verses that would present support for an end to the practice of sponsorship in its current form. With a competitive system; employers would be forced into better treatment of their workers in order to retain their valued staff. The result will be a more contented workforce and better products; both of which are beneficial for the employer. The resistance to a change in the present legislation could only be construed as a worrisome fear that employers would actually have to provide things for their employees that; heretofore; they have been able to overlook; i.e.; proper living situations; salaries paid on time and in full; and the choice by an employee to stay or leave for a different position. No one wins when an undervalued employee is retained against his will. If Qatar is the new &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; for expats; it is also still the land of perceived slave owners who are unwilling to give up their grasp on the chains that bind their employees and keep them subservient. That grasp enables sponsors to keep their workers tied to them&#8212;but only until the employees have outlived their usefulness. There is no dignity to be found in an environment such as this. Slavery goes against human dignity and is also against the spirit of Islam. Qatar needs to fulfill its role as a leader in the region by setting a new standard&#8212;a standard of human rights that was established by Islam.

I am new on QL and have noticed that its quite popular among residents of Qatar. I would like to remind people to please drive carefully on the roads and follow traffic rules. Its really shocking to see that people have no respect for fellow drivers; even for cars with babies/ children in them! I was almost hit this morning by a reckless driver driving on 80kmph on a small road in residential area; who did not look at the STOP sign stuck on his side of the road and just drove zipping past me. I drive with my baby (5 months old) in his car-seat; so I don't drive in a high speed and stick to the speed limit allowed for roads; which is why he missed hitting me. Had I been in the same speed as him; he would have hit my car really hard. I expect people to respect the 'Baby on board' sign that is stuck on cars. I was so angry with this driver and would have followed his car to slap him really hard; had my baby not been with me in the car. I just wanted to vent out my anger thats why I'm posting it here and I'm sure there are many of you that have experienced this situation before.

My earliest memories of Ramadan go back to my second or third grade year. But back then I remember Ramadan fell during winter; which meant fairly short days rather than the long burn of summer we&#8217;re experiencing today. The fast day normally ended around 5.30 and by 6:30 we would have prayed Maghrib and I&#8217;m already settled in front of the TV for another hilarious dose of the American Comedy Show &#8220; full house&#8221; and &#8220;wonder years&#8221; while munching on some Mama made Ramadan goodies. But the old days Ramadan was so much different so much fun; well at least for me!. Old days Ramadan wasn&#8217;t just about not eating and drinking forever! For us little folks it was more about motions. We awaited the month with lots of excitement and appreciated its gravity. We spend the day playing between studying and playing football and watching Ramadan kid&#8217;s quiz shows on TV with my cousins. And when night fell over we celebrated our Iftar with relief and gratitude. Mom&#8217;s Knafa never tasted so good. (: it still does actually: P There was a closeness I long to recapture. There are other things I also remember from my childhood Ramadan (: The subtle ache in my belly :P The memory of that first day of Ramadan sneaking in to the kitchen for a bite only to end up being caught by someone ( usually the elder females because they are fussing about the kitchen to make sure Iftar is ready and on time.

But good news is as adults we still excited about Ramadan and talk about it with anticipation and expectations.,no,"Input: My earliest memories of Ramadan go back to my second or third grade year. But back then I remember Ramadan fell during winter; which meant fairly short days rather than the long burn of summer we&#8217;re experiencing today. The fast day normally ended around 5.30 and by 6:30 we would have prayed Maghrib and I&#8217;m already settled in front of the TV for another hilarious dose of the American Comedy Show &#8220; full house&#8221; and &#8220;wonder years&#8221; while munching on some Mama made Ramadan goodies. But the old days Ramadan was so much different so much fun; well at least for me!. Old days Ramadan wasn&#8217;t just about not eating and drinking forever! For us little folks it was more about motions. We awaited the month with lots of excitement and appreciated its gravity. We spend the day playing between studying and playing football and watching Ramadan kid&#8217;s quiz shows on TV with my cousins. And when night fell over we celebrated our Iftar with relief and gratitude. Mom&#8217;s Knafa never tasted so good. (: it still does actually: P There was a closeness I long to recapture. There are other things I also remember from my childhood Ramadan (: The subtle ache in my belly :P The memory of that first day of Ramadan sneaking in to the kitchen for a bite only to end up being caught by someone ( usually the elder females because they are fussing about the kitchen to make sure Iftar is ready and on time.

Three women die together in an accident And go to heaven. When they get there; St. Peter says; 'We only have one rule here in heaven: Don't step on the ducks!' So they enter heaven; and sure enough; There are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck; and although they try their best to avoid them; the first woman accidentally steps on one. Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says; 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!' The next day; the second woman steps accidentally on a duck and along comes St. Peter; who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman. The third woman has observed all this and; not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man; is very; VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks; but one day St.Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on .... Very tall; long eyelashes; muscular. St. Peter chains them together without saying a word. The happy woman says; 'I wonder what I did to deserve being chained to you for all of eternity?' The guy says; 'I don't know about you; But I stepped on a Duck.,no,"Input: Three women die together in an accident And go to heaven.

Good reasons not to fly Air Frog or drink too much ... :O) An air hostess is facing ten years in prison after admitting stealing from business class passengers as they slept on long-haul flights. The 47-year-old was dubbed the &#8216;Mile High Pickpocket&#8217; after being caught following complaints about missing money; credit cards and designer jewellery. She would rifle through pockets and handbags; helping herself to the equivalent of &#163;3;700 in notes on one flight alone. The 47-year-old Air France employee was caught following complaints about missing cash; credit cards and jewellery &#8216;She knew that many of the passengers would fall asleep following a large meal and lots of alcohol. &#8216;This is the time that she would start rifling through their property; helping herself to whatever she could find.&#8217; The defendant; known for legal reasons solely as Lucie R; was finally arrested when she got off a Tokyo to Paris flight at 4.30am last Friday. Police had corroborated her flight rota with the huge number of crimes being reported. When confronted with the evidence against her; she confessed to 26 different thefts; during which everything from antique watches to cheque books were taken. Detectives charged her with the 26 offences while suggesting that numerous other thefts &#8216;undoubtedly took place&#8217;. He said that colleagues had also become suspicious of Lucie R&#8217;s lavish lifestyle. Despite officially earning less than &#163;40;000 a year; she regularly turned up for work in a top-of-the-range sports car and was buying plush apartments close to the airports where she worked. Detectives also raided a bank deposit box in her home town of Rouen; western France; where Lucie R had hidden stolen property including Cartier jewellery.

I'm writing the following just warn all QL readers to be careful with their belongings; especially NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING of value outside your homes on the porch or in your backyards or inside the cars. My road bike was stolen on 24th of December 2011; from right outside my house garage in the early morning hours. The Bike was parked and locked outside our house garage. So I never believed that it will be robbed in Qatar; because we live in a compound with security grads controlled gates and everything. .. However it happened. And From my observations and the way that the scum carried out their robbery; I&#8217;m pretty much convinced that; whoever stole the bike; they must have been watching and surveilling the house and the bike for a while; and must have had someone from inside the compound ( probably the grads) helping covering up for them while they carried out the robbery. Don't let this happen to you too. In the unfortunate case that it does happen to you; and if the garage was not broken in; go to Capital Police immediately.

First-year students at Veterinary school were attending their first Anatomy class; with a real dead animal. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a White sheet. The professor started the class by telling them; 'In Veterinary Medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a Doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the Animal body'. For an example; the Professor pulled back the sheet; touched his finger in the mouth of the dead animal; withdrew it and put his Finger in his mouth. 'Go ahead and do the same thing;' he told his students. The students freaked out; hesitated for several minutes. But eventually took turns putting their finger in the mouth of the dead pig and tasted in their mouth. When everyone finished; the Professor looked at them and said; 'The Second most important quality is observation. I touched with my middle Finger and tasted on my index finger.

DOHA: Long criticised for non-existent enforcement of anti-smoking law; Qatar&#8217;s public health authorities have swung into action and handed out fines to some 829 people so far this year for lighting up in public places. And the fines the health inspectors collected from the violators totalled an impressive QR319;000 &#8212; which means that on average a smoker caught paid QR385 in fine. The places raided by the inspectors included popular hangouts like the City Centre; The Mall; Villaggio; Hyatt Plaza; Landmark and Royal Plaza; among others. Interestingly; the health inspectors didn&#8217;t spare government offices; including ministry buildings; and raided them as well and caught violators. Responsible for ensuring a smoke-free Qatar; the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said in a release yesterday that inspectors from its anti-tobacco unit conducted 1;330 raids between January and mid-November this year at public places where smoking is banned. The SCH has reiterated in its release it would intensify monitoring and conduct more raids; especially as many violators were caught in shops located closer to schools. The SCH campaign assumes significance as it comes ahead of a law that is reported to be on the anvil; and; which many expect; could see the mushrooming &#8216;sheesha&#8217; joints; especially in residential localities and near schools; close down. During the latest anti-tobacco campaign of the SCH; however; what is surprising is that no &#8216;sheesha&#8217; outlet has been raided by its inspectors and no fines have been handed out to users to &#8216;sheesha&#8217; addicts; who; understandably; also include an increasing number of women and children. The current anti-tobacco law is described by anti-smoking activists as weak and lacking teeth as the punitive measures provided for are not deterring enough. Official figures suggest that some 16 percent of the Qatari population is addicted to smoking; and that includes &#8216;sheesha&#8217; as well. School students aren&#8217;t immune. A survey has recently been conducted by public health authorities to determine the extent to which smoking is prevalent in schools. Its findings are expected to help the SCH come up with ways that are effective enough in fighting this menace among youngsters. The authorities have recently made it mandatory for cigarette packets being sold in the local market to carry graphic images of deadly ailments smoking can cause; but its impact on the prevalence of smoking in the country is yet to be assessed. Some youngsters; instead of kicking the habit; have begun buying small steel &#8212; and sometimes silver &#8212; boxes so they could shift the cigarettes from what is a repulsive looking pack to a fancy case.

Two men; both seriously ill; occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families; their homes; their jobs; their involvement in the military service; where they had been on vacation.. Every afternoon; when the man in the bed by the window could sit up; he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and colour of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every colour and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details; the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene. One warm afternoon; the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days; weeks and months passed. One morning; the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window; who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate; the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch; and after making sure he was comfortable; she left him alone. Slowly; painfully; he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said; 'Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.' Epilogue: There is tremendous happiness in making others happy; despite our own situations. Shared grief is half the sorrow; but happiness when shared; is doubled. If you want to feel rich; just count all the things you have that money can't buy. 'Today is a gift; that is why it is called The Present .'

It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. What to eat and what to avoid this Ramadan --------------------------------------------------------- Have a light meal: Do not stuff yourself with food and drinks during or between Iftar and Suhoor. This contradicts the spirit of Ramadan and defeats the whole object of fasting. Health problems can emerge as a result of excess food intake which can &#8216;clog&#8217; your digestive system. At Iftar it is advisable to have a very light meal first &#8212; like dates and juices or soup and reserve the main meal for later after the Maghrib prayers perhaps or even after Taraweeh (special night prayers). The body&#8217;s immediate need is to get water and an easily available energy source in the form of glucose for every living cell; particularly the brain. What to eat: Due to the long hours of fasting; we should consume slow digesting foods including fibre-containing foods (which last up to 8 hours) rather than fast-digesting foods (which last for only 3-4 hours). Slow digesting foods contain grains and seeds like barley; wheat; oats; millet; semolina; beans; lentils; whole meal flour; unpolished rice; etc (called complex carbohydrates). Fibre-containing foods are bran; whole wheat; grains and seeds; vegetables like green beans; peas; spinach; the leaves of beetroot (iron-rich); fruit with skin; dried fruit especially dried apricots; and prunes; almonds; etc. Foods to avoid: Anything hot; spicy; hot or salty. Too much salty food will make your body retain water and give you the feeling of being bloated; while spicy foods also induce thirst. Sweets and sugary foods are fast-burning and will only last for 3-4 hours. Moreover; these will turn into fat; increase cholesterol levels and make you gain weight. Fried foods are unhealthy and should be limited. They cause indigestion; heartburn and weight problems. -------------------------------------------------------- What to drink: Drink sufficient water between Iftar and bedtime to avoid dehydration. Drinks with high caffeine content (coffee; tea; chocolate; sodas and even decaffeinated teas and coffees) should be avoided. Caffeine leaches calcium from your system; which means you feel less full all the time. Avoid drinking tea at suhoor (dawn); as tea increases salt excretion in the urine; which is needed for your body during fasting. --------------------------------------------------------- Do not skip Suhoor: Dieticians warn that those who are fasting should not skip the morning meal as this is needed to get you through the day. Many people eat a late night meal and sleep through till the dawn prayers. This is not advisable. Self-discipline: As Ramadan fasting is basically an exercise in self-discipline; for those who are chain smokers; food nibblers or caffeine addicts (coffee; tea; coke; and chocolate); it is a good opportunity to break the habit; hoping that the effect will continue when the month is over. It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. --------------------------------------------------------- Fasting and weight loss: Fasting is a good way of losing weight; however some people even put on weight during Ramadan. The basic equation is simple &#8211; you must balance the calories that you take in with the calories that go out. If you consistently eat more calories than you burn; you will tend to store up the excess as fat. Exercising will help you maintain your body weight; it will help burn calories and get rid of stress. ---------------------------------------------------------,no,"Input: It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings.

"Qatari Premier and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem al-Thani (C) at a recent meeting in Libya. Photograph: AFP DOHA - Qatar is considering ending the oft-criticised sponsorship system; under which employers sponsor foreign workers and have a great deal of control over them; the prime minister said on Thursday. ""Changes have been made to the sponsorship system in Qatar;"" and the council of ministers is ""seriously studying"" abolishing the system; Sheikh Hamad told reporters. ""We are studying the issue very carefully to preserve the rights of citizens and foreign workers;"" he added. Sponsorship systems for foreign workers exist in most Gulf countries; which employ millions of foreigners; especially from Asia. The system has been strongly criticised by rights groups and likened to modern-day slavery. In some cases; employers hold workers' passports and can deny them permission to change jobs. Bahrain abolished the system in 2009; and Kuwait reportedly plans to do so by February. Sheikh Hamad also said on Thursday that Qatar was not yet ready to hold its first partial parliamentary elections; which have been promised for several years. ""The legislative elections will be held one day... We have fallen behind in completing various laws; of which three quarters have been adopted;"" he said. The principle of a partly elected parliament was enshrined in the Gulf state's constitution which came into force in 2005.

Very nice and a beautiful morning today. Just wanna write something motivational which will help me and many of you as well. Well&#8230; Lemme start with a story which I heard from one of my mentor long back. &#8220;&#8220;&#8220;&#8220;Once a young man was trying to do suicide to kill himself and was blaming God and others for not helping him. An greybeard man was hearing his words. Their conversation goes like that. Greybeard Man : Hi Stop please don&#8217;t do that. Young Man : Ohh no Why should I stop. What is life all about . I don&#8217;t have anything to live so its better to die than live with nothing. Greybeard Man : Ok Man. I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your eyes. Young Man : No way I cant live see without my eyes. Greybeard Man : Ok I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your kidneys. Young Man : Ohh no I cant live without my kidneys. Greybeard Man then repeated all the important parts of his body and asked him to sell them for money but the man was continuously denying to do that.

An greybeard man was hearing his words. Their conversation goes like that. Greybeard Man : Hi Stop please don&#8217;t do that. Young Man : Ohh no Why should I stop. What is life all about . I don&#8217;t have anything to live so its better to die than live with nothing. Greybeard Man : Ok Man. I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your eyes. Young Man : No way I cant live see without my eyes. Greybeard Man : Ok I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your kidneys. Young Man : Ohh no I cant live without my kidneys. Greybeard Man then repeated all the important parts of his body and asked him to sell them for money but the man was continuously denying to do that.

The Israeli offensive in Gaza has killed nearly 600 Palestinians in ground and air strikes. Israel launched the attacks Dec. 27 to stop Palestinian militants from firing rockets into southern Israel. ""How far will this barbarism go?"" Chavez asked on state television before the ambassador's expulsion was announced. ""The president of Israel should be taken before an international court together with the president of the United States; if the world had any conscience."" Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said its U.N. mission is joining with other countries in demanding the Security Council ""apply urgent and necessary measures to stop this invasion."" Israeli diplomats could not immediately be reached for comment. The embassy in Caracas was closed; and it was unclear how the Israeli government would respond. Jewish community leader Abraham Levy; president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Israelite Associations; called the government's decision ""taking the side of a terrorist group"" by backing Gaza's Hamas leaders while ignoring Israel's perspective. ""I deeply lament that decision made by the government; which cuts off an enormous and long tradition of friendship between the people of Israel and the people of Venezuela;"" Levy told The Associated Press. He said the decision leaves Venezuela's Jewish community &#8212; which numbers nearly 15;000 &#8212; ""not only worried but also deeply battered"" because it ""attempts to demonize the state of Israel."" While many countries have protested Israel's offensive; none besides Venezuela so far have expelled the ambassador. Mauritania; which established relations with Israel in 1999; called home its ambassador from the Jewish state on Monday. Jordan and Egypt; the other two Arab nations with relations with Israel; summoned their Israeli ambassadors to protest the Gaza attacks; but they have resisted popular calls to expel them. Chavez has long been critical of the Israeli government's policies in the Middle East and has supported the Palestinians' stance in the conflict. During Israel's 2006 conflict in Lebanon; Chavez withdrew his top envoy from Israel; calling the bombings there ""a new Holocaust."" Relations have remained at a scaled-back level since. Chavez's condemnations of Israel's offensive in Gaza have grown gradually more severe in recent days. On Monday he called the Jewish state a ""genocidal government;"" and on Tuesday urged Jews in Venezuela to take a stand against the Israeli government. In spite of harsh criticisms of Israel; Chavez's government has insisted it is friendly toward Jewish people.

"Another Filipina worker killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait JERRIE M. ABELLA; GMANews.TV 10/24/2010 | 10:55 PM The Philippine Embassy in Kuwait has confirmed that the decomposing body of a woman found over a week ago on the roof of a building in that small; oil-rich Middle Eastern country was that of a Filipina worker. Vice Consul Rea Oreta said; in a phone interview Sunday with GMANews.TV; that the victim was identified based on her passport as Jenny Dechosa; 33; from Misamis Oriental. &#8220;(Kuwait&#8217;s) Criminal Investigation Division (CID) has just confirmed to us that the victim was indeed a Filipina; and her case is now under investigation;"" Oreta said. According to her; the CID likewise told the Embassy that an Egyptian national has been arrested in connection to the crime and is now detained at the Bayan Police Station. Oreta said the CID has refused to release more information on Dechosa&#8217;s case as it is considered &#8220;confidential;"" but reports state the suspect was the victim&#8217;s lover. &#8220;Right now we are requesting the help of the OUMWA (Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs) to locate the family of Dechosa because all we have is her passport;"" Oreta said. Missing since Oct. 10 A report by the Kuwait-based Arab Times said Dechosa&#8217;s body was found by police authorities on October 16 in between air-conditioning units on the roof of Hall No. 5 at the Kuwait International Fair grounds in Mishref. According to the report; Dechosa was working in a saloon in Salmiya and does part-time work as a house cleaner. Quoting Dechosa&#8217;s housemates; the report said the victim left their house on October 10; her rest day; for a part-time cleaning job in Mishref. She; however; reportedly backed out of the job as the house was too big and instead asked the taxi driver to drop her off a shopping mall where she was supposedly meeting someone. Dechosa was unable to go home that day; and six days after she was reported missing; a body of a woman in a state of decomposition was found in Mishref. On the same day; her employer and housemates confirmed that the body was indeed Dechosa&#8217;s through fingerprinting and other pieces of evidence; even as her face was reportedly unrecognizable as it seemed to have been smashed with a hard object; the Arab Times report said. A separate report on Arab Times on Saturday identified the suspect as the Egyptian caretaker of the building where Dechosa&#8217;s body was discovered. The report said the suspect was identified based on the victim&#8217;s mobile phone records. The suspect reportedly confessed he had an affair with Dechosa; and admitted killing her by hitting her with a metal rod on her head. The motive for the killing; however; remains unclear. According to Vice Consul Oreta; Dechosa&#8217;s remains may take at least a month to be repatriated; or as soon as the CID and the local prosecutor finish their investigation. OFW-friendly? The killing of Dechosa came three months after two other Filipinas were brutally killed in separate incidents in Kuwait; which has been identified by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs as one of the countries where the rights and welfare of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are protected. In July; a Filipina worker was tortured to death by her employer and then left in the desert; while another was stabbed dead at least 31 times by her Egyptian husband allegedly in a fit of jealousy. Government agencies have likewise repatriated Filipino workers from Kuwait by the hundreds in the last few months; majority of them household service workers who ran away from their sponsors for various reasons; such as labor contract violations and physical abuse; or are overstaying in the country. Oreta declined to comment if Kuwait&#8217;s classification as a safe country for migrant workers will be reviewed in light of the recent string of killings and abuses of Filipino laborers in the Middle East country. Kuwait ranks sixth in the top ten destinations of OFWs in 2009; with some 45;900 Filipino workers deployed there on the same year; according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Records from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas meanwhile show there are over 140;000 Filipinos in Kuwait as of 2008; only 500 of whom are considered permanent residents. &#8211; DM/KBK; GMANews.TV",no,"Input: Another Filipina worker killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait JERRIE M.

That means they will miss the last group G game against Auxerre; but the match is irrelevant as Real have already qualified as winners.

"Two-year-old Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes were among the 13 children killed in the fire which broke out in the Villaggio Mall in Doha. The grandfather of the triplets killed in a blaze at a daycare centre in a Doha shopping mall says he struggles to see how he will ever be happy again. The fire ripped through the Gympanzee childcare centre in the Villaggio (correct) mall in the capital Doha at 11.30 am (8 pm NZT); killing 19 people and injuring 17. New Zealand-born triplets Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes; aged two; were among those killed in the fire. They were the only children of expats Jane and Martin Weekes. The grandfather of the triplets; Ron Turner; told Newstalk ZB he and his wife would be travelling to Doha tonight to be with their daughter and son-in-law. They had been contacted by Ms Weekes just after the babies had been found and were told they had died of smoke inhalation. ""She was still just as numb I suppose; and just as empty as my wife and I feel right now and the rest of our family and friends who have rallied around to give us support. "" The triplets had been going to the day-care three mornings a week for the past couple of months; Mr Turner said. ""That gave them an opportunity to meet more children and be involved in a different environment than home and mum and dad and nannies; and they were so proud to show off their school bags.'' The triplets' bodies would be brought back to New Zealand; he said. Just last week Ms Weekes wrote on babycenter.com of potty training the trio. ""We have about 7 potties around our living space (it's a really big open plan area and is tiled so we have no issues with accidents) and in the bathroom to be able to sit one on the toilet with a kiddy seat and 1 or 2 on the potties if it turned into rush.'' New Zealand journalist Tarek Bazley; who lives 1km from the mall in Doha; was in another part of the mall with his children when the fire broke out. ""The first thing I heard of it was a very benign fire alarm; it sounded more like a doorbell to be honest; repeating in the background;'' he told Radio New Zealand. After 15 minutes he asked an attendant whether he should be worried; but was told to ""sit tight'' and that it was usually a false alarm. ""About 10 minutes later; someone else; a member of the public; raced through this area and said; `Everybody out; you've got to get out now. The other half of the mall is on fire.' That is what he said to me.'' ""I believe the problem was that once the fire took in the area near the nursery; there was no way to actually escape.'' Both exits were blocked by smoke; he said. The alarm and sprinkler system appeared to have malfunctioned. ""It's an extraordinary mall in the sense that as you walk down it it has this ceiling that is like a mock sky; so I think in order to achieve that effect; they've actually not put in sprinklers in this area.'' Fire-fighters had to break through the roof to get to trapped children after a staircase to the first-floor nursery collapsed; an official said. Dense smoke inside the mall; combined with the fierce temperature from the flames; made reaching the trapped children very difficult; a representative of the civil defence told a news conference. Prime Minister John Key this morning said New Zealand Foreign Affairs staff were travelling to Doha from Saudi Arabia to provide support for the Weekes' family. ""Their family are obviously dealing with the terrible grief that they have at this time. Obviously it's a very tragic day for that family.'' Labour leader David Shearer also sent his condolences to the family. ""I join with all other New Zealanders in expressing my heartfelt sympathies to the parents; extended family; and friends; of the three young children caught up in such a tragic event. The pain of their loss is unimaginable.",no,"Input: Two-year-old Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes were among the 13 children killed in the fire which broke out in the Villaggio Mall in Doha.

The grandfather of the triplets; Ron Turner; told Newstalk ZB he and his wife would be travelling to Doha tonight to be with their daughter and son-in-law. They had been contacted by Ms Weekes just after the babies had been found and were told they had died of smoke inhalation. ""She was still just as numb I suppose; and just as empty as my wife and I feel right now and the rest of our family and friends who have rallied around to give us support. "" The triplets had been going to the day-care three mornings a week for the past couple of months; Mr Turner said. ""That gave them an opportunity to meet more children and be involved in a different environment than home and mum and dad and nannies; and they were so proud to show off their school bags.'' The triplets' bodies would be brought back to New Zealand; he said. Just last week Ms Weekes wrote on babycenter.com of potty training the trio. ""We have about 7 potties around our living space (it's a really big open plan area and is tiled so we have no issues with accidents) and in the bathroom to be able to sit one on the toilet with a kiddy seat and 1 or 2 on the potties if it turned into rush.'' New Zealand journalist Tarek Bazley; who lives 1km from the mall in Doha; was in another part of the mall with his children when the fire broke out. ""The first thing I heard of it was a very benign fire alarm; it sounded more like a doorbell to be honest; repeating in the background;'' he told Radio New Zealand. After 15 minutes he asked an attendant whether he should be worried; but was told to ""sit tight'' and that it was usually a false alarm. ""About 10 minutes later; someone else; a member of the public; raced through this area and said; `Everybody out; you've got to get out now. The other half of the mall is on fire.' That is what he said to me.'' ""I believe the problem was that once the fire took in the area near the nursery; there was no way to actually escape.'' Both exits were blocked by smoke; he said. The alarm and sprinkler system appeared to have malfunctioned. ""It's an extraordinary mall in the sense that as you walk down it it has this ceiling that is like a mock sky; so I think in order to achieve that effect; they've actually not put in sprinklers in this area.'' Fire-fighters had to break through the roof to get to trapped children after a staircase to the first-floor nursery collapsed; an official said. Dense smoke inside the mall; combined with the fierce temperature from the flames; made reaching the trapped children very difficult; a representative of the civil defence told a news conference. Prime Minister John Key this morning said New Zealand Foreign Affairs staff were travelling to Doha from Saudi Arabia to provide support for the Weekes' family. ""Their family are obviously dealing with the terrible grief that they have at this time. Obviously it's a very tragic day for that family.'' Labour leader David Shearer also sent his condolences to the family. ""I join with all other New Zealanders in expressing my heartfelt sympathies to the parents; extended family; and friends; of the three young children caught up in such a tragic event. The pain of their loss is unimaginable. Answer: no

If you&#8217;re thinking of buying a new Kia car then think again! I have recently bought one in fact I have just taken it for its first (1000km) service. The car had a problem with the door handle and needed replacing. They said they had fixed it with lubrication but needless to say as soon as I inspected it; it was still the same! It took a stand up row with the supervisor at AL_ATTIYA Motors (Industrial area) to get him to order the part so that the door handle could be replaced (it still has not been replaced). ALSO...I left just under a &#188; tank of fuel in the car. When I picked the car up the following day; the fuel tank was TOTALLY empty with the display showing that I had 0 km to go before the tank was dry! There were no extra km on the odometer so the car must have been left &#8216;ticking over&#8217; for HOURS on end to exhaust the fuel. The car manual specifically says that the engine should not be left idling for longer than 3 minutes before 2000km!!! You would think that the &#8216;mechanics&#8217; would know this. I was worried about taking the car because I was concerned that I would run out of fuel....the supervisor seemed unconcerned and offered no explanation.

"Dubai: A police lieutenant colonel; six lieutenants and six officers have been referred to court on charges of using torture and extensive beatings during an interrogation which allegedly led to the death of a Pakistani man and left two others with injuries. Prosecutors levelled a number of charges against the 13 Dubai Police personnel; varying from abuse of power; unlawful detention of the deceased B.K. and his two compatriots; torture; extensive use of force during interrogation; forgery and giving a false statement during official questioning by a public prosecutor. Dubai Police's forensic doctor testified that B.K. died after being badly beaten which left him with acute bleeding in his brain. B.K.'s injured compatriots were identified as S.H.; 38; and M.S.; 33. According to the forensic doctor's prosecution statement; M.S. sustained burns which were caused by a chemical substance used to remove rust. ""There were bruises; cuts and injuries over different parts of his body as well. Due to the severe and extensive beating; M.S. suffered a critical kidney failure. Meanwhile S.H. was beaten by hands and ghutras [head dress cord worn by local men] and kicked;"" the doctor claimed. The 13 suspects; including nine Emiratis; two Pakistanis and two Omanis; are scheduled to appear before the Dubai Court of First Instance on May 31. According to the charges sheet; prosecutors accused the brigadier; four lieutenants and four officers; with unlawfully locking up B.K. in Naif police station. Records said B.K.; M.S. and S.H. were allegedly wanted for an investigation related to a kidnapping case that caused death. Dubai Police Chief Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim earlier told Gulf News that if the investigation uncovered negligence or culpability; those involved would have to face the law. An Eritrean ambulance paramedic testified that she and her colleagues were asked to head to Naif police station because there was a problem. ""We were not informed what happened. When we reached there; I saw B.K. on the floor. He had bruises on his body. He was already dead although we tried to resuscitate him and gave him five electric shocks&#8230; but it was too late.""",no,"Input: Dubai: A police lieutenant colonel; six lieutenants and six officers have been referred to court on charges of using torture and extensive beatings during an interrogation which allegedly led to the death of a Pakistani man and left two others with injuries.

Hence the new passport application was rejected for my infant even though i have provided a sworn affidavit from Indian Embassy from Qatar. Now i have left with only option to endorse spouse name in my wife passport. However this will we be a reissue of new passport as per the rule. currently my family passport is having a Valid Qatar RP . Now what all i want to know is do i need to Transfer my Family Visa to Newly issued passport before arriving to Doha or it is not required as it can be done upon arrival to Doha.

Hey; a strange experience folks. When ever you are travelling please check if your RP / Visa is valid at least for a period of 6 months. My RP expires on 16 Nov.2010; while the Immigration counter cleared with their seal; the guy Pravesh of Qatar Airways in the departure lounge never permitted me to board the flight at the last minute. I showed my return flight is within 48 hours; even if he wants me have a longer vacation;I cannot stay away; as I joined my employer 8 months back. I showed my EXIT permit and I am travelling to Muscat just for 2 days for a family commitment. As per GCC regulations the Visa is stamped for 2 years and RP renewed every year; I don't know how the Visa was also stamped for one year in my case. He took me to his Supervisor another Kid of 24; 25 years ; I mentioned I have lived in the GCC for 24 years and I would not jeopardise my job nor their job; but the guy went on blabbering 'I don't want to lose my job' again and again. I pity the plight of these youngsters; who would not understand practicality - while my stay in the airport for 2 hours such chaos and passengers speaking high tone and getting away for excess baggage and what not; I politely asked me to show me the counter for processing the refund and walked home with disappointment; afterall a week end trip to Muscat and back was futile. Please check the RP well before you plan your trip; just a caution so that you do not face the same disappointment; specially if it is a annual vacation.

"ABU DHABI -- The Ministry of Interior yesterday withdrew the ""six-month ban"" system imposed by the Immigration and Residency authorities on various categories of workers upon the cancellation of expatriates' employment visa. The decision; that will have a major impact and implications on the UAE labour market; has come into force with immediate effect. The Naturalisation and Residency Departments stopped stamping the ban on passports while processing cancellation of employment visas. Ahmed Al Hamadi; in-charge of Passport Office at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; said: ""We received a letter from the Immigration and Residency Department with instructions from Interior Minister Lt-Gen. Shaikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan not to stamp the ban on applications for cancelling visas. The decision was put into effect yesterday when we cancelled employment visas without imposing the ban."" He said the office received hundreds of applications yesterday; which were processed without slapping the six-month ban. For employers; it will now be easier to hire talents from within the country. For the millions of expats working in various capacities; barring maids; the news should come as manna from heaven; for there would now be free movement of workforce in the country. Employers can get the best talent available in the market without the hassle of seeking the ""No Objection Certificate"" from the current sponsor. Ministry sources told Khaleej Times that under instructions from Lt.-Gen. Shaikh Saif; the ministry circulated the decree among all Immigration and Residency Departments in the country; and that the decision came into effect yesterday. On the categories included in the decree; the official said only housemaids were excluded for the time being; and that a special committee would be set up to study their case. ""Housemaids were not included in the decision. A special panel will be formed to study the possibilities of exempting this category also from the ban;"" said the official. He said the decision was in line with Cabinet Decree No. 18 of 2005 on sponsorship transfer of employees in the private sector; under which a fee of Dh1;500 for masters and doctorate holders; Dh3;000 for bachelors degree holders and Dh5;000 for certificates lower than bachelors degree would be levied. A special panel comprising senior officials had been set up in February to look into various aspects of streamlining the residence and labour market laws. Hitherto; only those who met the requisite conditions for sponsorship transfer; including consent of sponsor; completion of one-year in a company and a valid residence visa; among others; were eligible to change jobs within the country without getting their passports stamped with the six-month ban. In practice; however; movement of labour force was virtually impossible with hardly any sponsor willing to write out a no objection certificate. Meanwhile; most employees and employers who were processing their applications at the ministry yesterday; seemed overwhelmed by the decision and welcomed the measure which they said was bound to improve labour relations. Ahmed Ibrahim; an investor; said: ""the decision is excellent. It will spare employees the hassles they face with employers.""Abdul Jalil Rahma; owner of Noon Contracting and Construction Company; said : ""The ban was never in favour of employees. Scrapping the ban will free employees of the threat posed by some employers; leading to relinquishment of their entitlements in favour of release."" While most of the GCC countries trying their best to reduce the hassles of employees; here in Doha; some were requested to increase the re-entry ban to 5 years.

The Court ruled that the law caused an 'unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex' because fathers do not have the same rights as mothers The new legislation means that both the mother and father are allowed to leave work for an hour during the day or reduce their working day by half an hour during the first nine months following the birth of a child. The European Union Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled on Thursday that the Spanish law caused an ""unjustified discrimination on grounds of sex"" because fathers do not have the same rights as mothers.

Breastfeeding leave should now be considered as ""time purely devoted to the child"" in order to reconcile family life and work after maternity leave. Source: Telegraph Answer: no

"Is this bad taste or just a contest where the winner actually WINS ! A New Zealand radio station has been criticised for running a contest giving male listeners the chance to win a wife. The winner of The Rock FM's competition will be flown to Ukraine for 12 nights to pick their future wife from a bride agency. ""If you're interested in holy matrimony with a potentially hot foreign chick; fill it out to the best of your abilities."" Not to be put off by the complaints; numerous men have entered the competition and appear happy to have their profiles shown on the radio's website.

So yesterday I was with my family at Doha City. I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop. An hour later; I heard someone tapping on the window. I looked up to see a man; of South Asian descent tapping on my window. 'Salam Aleikum;' he said when I looked up. I lowered the window and asked him what he wanted. Realizing I was Indian; he started speaking in Urdu and narrated a extremely pitiful story of how his hand was fractured and he had no money to treat it. He asked me for some cash. I told him I hadn't any after which he began begging again and said he wanted to go back to his home country. I didn't see the relation between his swollen hand and his desire to go back to his home; but the sight of the hand was disturbing. I relented and gave him five riyals. He looked at it and walked away without a word of Thanks. He then intercepted two Caucasian women walking to their car right behind mine. I lowered the window and watched. He narrated the same story. They listened; ignored him and drove away. A few minutes later; my Father stepped out of the store. I told him about the incident. He immediately understood and told me I should not have paid him. He told me about an incident near the Family Food Center at Bombay Chowpatty where he met someone similar who showed him a 'plastic bag that ran to his kidney' and begged him for money. Out of pity; when my dad gave him QR 50 he said it was 'not enough'. A waiter at Bombay Chowpatty then warned him against that there was a gang of panhandlers; most of whom are from the Indian subcontinent; who fake medical conditions to solicit money primarily from expats. I then spied him and pointed him out at which point he began to run away. Please do not indulge these people's requests if you encounter them. The Qatari police are supposedly on the lookout. They seem to congregate at expat heavy areas in Doha.,no,"Input: So yesterday I was with my family at Doha City. I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop.

"From Ifancy To Adulthood: From the moment we are born we are barraged by manipulation; conditioning; and pressure to become the image of what is around us.

Please find below a letter to Gulf Times Editor written br Mr. Abdul Nasar A. K. and published in today's GT For your comments. _________________________________________________________ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Winter agony for KG kids Dear Sir; It is heart-rending for parents to awake their KG-going children early in the morning; around 5 o&#8217;clock; for school every day in winter. Every morning I feel extremely guilty when I force my four-year-old daughter to get up at that time so that she can go to school. If our children are genuinely conscious of their rights they would file a lawsuit against their parents to protect them from this type of &#8220;abuse&#8221;! It is a type of torture and cruelty even though our actions are inspired by good intentions and the future well-being of our kids itself. But good intentions cannot always justify actions. Nevertheless; my suggestion to expatriate school managements is to consider changing timing for KG pupils from January to March at least. Classes for the above category now start at the same time as for senior grades and end by 11am. Special buses then take the kids back home. It will not be an additional burden for school managements if they deploy these buses to collect KG students from their houses by 9am and start their classes by 10am. KG classes could end by 1pm as with senior pupils and they can all return home in one bus. I would like to request all parents to come forward with their suggestions. School authorities also can make a survey to know how parents think about this suggestion; if they see it worth considering.

Hi folks; I am moving to Qatar in 10 days. My employer (Barwa) just asked me to bring a UK police clearance with a stamp from the ministry of foreign affairs. I assume this is to show proof that there are no legal or criminal convictions against me. I've just been to my local police station who say they won't provide this kind of information. They gave me the contact details for Disclosure Scotland; a govt department; who process these disclosures. Unfortunately this takes about 40 days end to end and I only have 10...

I have been working in Qatar since August 2011 and have completed my 2 years contract with my employer. It is not just the workers in construction side but also management level professionals been treated like slaves. And the worst part is that we (Immigrants) can't take any action against the employers here. I was working with a local employer in the hospitality section as IT Manager. I was promised that I will get release/NOC after completing my two years contract with the company. I did completed my contract and found another opportunity with a high package and family benefits. I have two kids; one 11 months old and the other two and half year old; for me the important thing was to look for something that could help me to get the best health and living facilities for my kids; which was offered by the new company. I gave a notice period of 40 days to my company with a written request to get NOC to work in Qatar and my management confirmed in writing that I shall be getting my NOC. The time I completed my 40 days&#8217; notice with a proper handover; the company refused to give me NOC and thus I became jobless. Because I left the company and I cannot join another one; I have nothing to survive. I have bank liabilities taken for my family support; now the bank is asking me to clear the liabilities which I cannot because my ex. employer hasn&#8217;t paid my end of services and still holding my passport and I have no work even to feed my kids so how can I pay the bank. Bank is not allowing me to go out of the country because of the liabilities and my ex. company is not giving me release to work anywhere else in Qatar. If I couldn't pay the bank they can put me in jail that makes me worry because I don&#8217;t know what will happen to my kids. I tried to go the human rights commission here in Qatar but I was strictly informed not to file any complaint or case against the local employer as they will put me and my family in more troubles.

"How can we allow this to go on ? Help stop it NOW! Millions of male chicks are killed every year by the egg industry; according to new undercover footage from animal campaigners; that shows the tiny birds on a ""conveyor belt to death"". The birds are dropped onto a conveyor belt where they are sorted by sex. The males are apparently either thrown alive into electronic mincers or instantly gassed to death. The females are kept for laying; but only after they have been placed in a machine that clips off the end of their beaks and jabs them against disease. Viva! visited two hatcheries in Preston. At Tom Barron hatchery they claimed the male chicks were gassed in a giant machine and their bodies packaged to be fed to reptiles. At Fresh Farm Hatchery they claim the birds are thrown directly into a mincer and used for fertiliser. The birds are sorted for sex according to colour. In the gassing method whole crates of males are put in a chamber and then packaged once they are dead. The mincing or &#8216;instantaneous mechanical destruction&#8217; is usually a quicker route to death and is widely used in the US.
