Dear All; I am from India and i have masters from the Top Uni in UK. I have been offered a traffic engineer role at Parsons. The package that is offered is very low. It is 8K; plus there won't be any sponsorship for my family. I am very upset about the offer but the role is in my field and is good for my career. The problem is i feel i am being undervalued here because of the Poor European condition. I want to know; would i be able to sponsor my family (in near future) with this salary. (basic 5200+living allowance 2800). I also want to know; if i could change the company after a certain period of time as i feel the salary in very low but i need the job so i am thinking abt accepting it. I believe seasoned people in this forum might provide a helpful guide to me.,yes,"Input: Dear All; I am from India and i have masters from the Top Uni in UK.

Dear Friends; Greetings! Recently i was told at Indian Passport office at India is that spouse name must be endorsed in Parents Passports in order to obtain passport for infant. unfortunately my wife passport does not have spouse name endorsed. Hence the new passport application was rejected for my infant even though i have provided a sworn affidavit from Indian Embassy from Qatar. Now i have left with only option to endorse spouse name in my wife passport. However this will we be a reissue of new passport as per the rule. currently my family passport is having a Valid Qatar RP . Now what all i want to know is do i need to Transfer my Family Visa to Newly issued passport before arriving to Doha or it is not required as it can be done upon arrival to Doha.

I worked 9 months with a private co as a manager. I was asked to resign with a promise to give NOC with one month notice (as per contract 2 month notice if employee resigns). HR sent me email on the first day after submitting resignation confirming to provide NOC. On that assurance; I searched jobs here and when approached for NOC after getting job; they refused to give NOC. After more request asked to show offer letter; then submitted again request letter as they wanted. Still I am being troubled and waiting for NOC. Now; if finally they don't give NOC and cancel my visa; can I lodge complaint with CID or labout dept or with both as I have email proof of confirmation to give me NOC.,yes,"Input: I worked 9 months with a private co as a manager.

Hi Guys; Good day. I'm under my husband's sponsorship til today but his contract will be ending this April 30. Good thing he's been hired with another company. Sadly; the company will not give release but only NOC so that means we need to go back to our country (cancelled). Plan is;he will come after a week or two after exiting then coming back with a visit visa with the new company. My question is; how fast can my husband gets his New RP and sponsor me and my daughter. Some told us that we need to present again 6 months bank statements. (All our accounts are expected to be closed before exiting). Problem is i have a new offer already but they can't wait that long till i can come back. Your thoughts on this please.,yes,"Input: Hi Guys; Good day.

So yesterday I was with my family at Doha City. I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop. An hour later; I heard someone tapping on the window. I looked up to see a man; of South Asian descent tapping on my window. 'Salam Aleikum;' he said when I looked up. I lowered the window and asked him what he wanted. Realizing I was Indian; he started speaking in Urdu and narrated a extremely pitiful story of how his hand was fractured and he had no money to treat it. He asked me for some cash. I told him I hadn't any after which he began begging again and said he wanted to go back to his home country. I didn't see the relation between his swollen hand and his desire to go back to his home; but the sight of the hand was disturbing. I relented and gave him five riyals. He looked at it and walked away without a word of Thanks. He then intercepted two Caucasian women walking to their car right behind mine. I lowered the window and watched. He narrated the same story. They listened; ignored him and drove away. A few minutes later; my Father stepped out of the store. I told him about the incident. He immediately understood and told me I should not have paid him. He told me about an incident near the Family Food Center at Bombay Chowpatty where he met someone similar who showed him a 'plastic bag that ran to his kidney' and begged him for money. Out of pity; when my dad gave him QR 50 he said it was 'not enough'. A waiter at Bombay Chowpatty then warned him against that there was a gang of panhandlers; most of whom are from the Indian subcontinent; who fake medical conditions to solicit money primarily from expats. I then spied him and pointed him out at which point he began to run away. Please do not indulge these people's requests if you encounter them. The Qatari police are supposedly on the lookout. They seem to congregate at expat heavy areas in Doha.,no,"Input: So yesterday I was with my family at Doha City. I decided to stay back in the car and read while my parents went inside to shop.

Hello! good day to everyone. I accidentally opened this website when I surf the net on how to apply for a visit visa. I have a friend in Qatar and she's willing to apply a visit visa for me; but the problem is about my surname; she told me that my visa cannot process because they cannot find a person with the same surname i have; and they told me that it's one of the requirements that needed. I just want know is it still possible for me to go to Qatar with a visit visa even if they cannot find a person with the same surname? Please help; need an advise.

Antony Masla today became the first Indian driver in the State of Qatar to legally obtain his drivers licence after taking the driving test a record 264 times. Antony whose previous driving experience was a cow (5 ltr; milk)in Uttar Pradesh now has the keys to a Toyota LC for his employers. Bungling reported and part time pervert Sheik Midick of the Gulf-Penisular caught up with Antony on his first ever legal drive. 'Like every other Indian in Qatar I had been driving for 12 years without a licence or instruction but I wanted that clear plastic licence to show my family back home that I made it. It took me a while to realise that nudging other cars out of the way was unacceptable and would lead to failure after failure at the driving school. When we rode cows it was ok but now I accept cars are different beasts' When we enquired if there was any downside to having a legal driving licence Antony responded; 'some of my old friends shun me now as they think I have become to good for them; but I'm still the same guy that changes lanes randomly and when he parks I park over the parking lines not between them. I say look at my vehicle; look at the scratches that has not changed! The other thing is all these points on my licence. I'm not sure what they are for; can I exchange them for roti's at Lulu?' On contacting the traffic police for comment they proudly stated that they have now issued 3 driving licences for Indians; one to a Pakistani who unfortunatly has now left the country and 4 to the Nepalese one of which is now the highest qualifed person in his country.

Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion is the body&#8217;s response to an excessive loss of the water and salt contained in sweat. Those most prone to heat exhaustion are elderly people; people with high blood pressure and people working or exercising in a hot environment. Warning Signs of Heat Exhaustion Include: Heavy sweating Paleness Muscle cramps Tiredness and weakness Dizziness or fainting Headache Nausea or vomiting What to Do Rest in a cool; preferably air-conditioned; area. Loosen clothing. Cool down with a shower; bath or sponge bath Drink plenty of non-alcoholic and caffeine-free beverages. Seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or last longer than one hour. Heat Stroke (Life Threatening) Heat stroke occurs when the body becomes unable to control its temperature: the body&#8217;s temperature rises rapidly; the sweating mechanism fails; and the body is unable to cool down. Heat stroke can develop within minutes or hours. Heat stroke can cause death or permanent disability if emergency treatment is not given. Treatment includes rapidly lowering the person&#8217;s body temperature followed by intensive supportive care. Warning Signs of Heat Stroke Vary But May Include: Extremely high body temperature (above 103&#176; F orally) Red; hot and dry skin (no sweating) Rapid pulse Throbbing headache Dizziness Nausea Confusion Unconsciousness What to Do Call for immediate medical assistance. Move the victim to a cool or shady area. Cool the victim rapidly using whatever methods you can. (For example; immerse the victim in a tub of cool water; place in a cool shower; spray with cool water from a garden hose or sponge with cool water. Avoid use of fans; see paragraphs below.) Monitor body temperature; and continue cooling efforts until the body temperature drops to 101-102&#176; F. Do not give the victim alcohol to drink. Get medical assistance as soon as possible. How To Prevent Heat-Related Illness Be aware of the warning signs of heat-related illness; such as light-headedness; mild nausea or confusion; sleepiness or profuse sweating. While outdoors; rest frequently in a shady area so that your body's thermostat has a chance to recover. Schedule outdoor activities carefully; preferably before noon or in the evening; If unaccustomed to working or exercising in a hot environment; start slowly; pick up the pace gradually and limit your exercise or work time. Wear sunscreen to protect skin from the sun's harmful rays. Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself and causes a loss of body fluids. Wear lightweight; light-colored; loose-fitting clothing. When working in the heat; monitor the condition of your co-workers and have someone do the same for you. If you are 65 years of age or older; have a friend or relative call to check on you twice a day when hot weather health advisories have been issued. Stay indoors and in an air-conditioned environment. If air conditioning is not available; consider a visit to a shopping mall; public library; movie theater; supermarket or other air-conditioned location for a few hours. Increase your fluid intake&#8212;regardless of your activity level. Don't wait until you feel thirsty to drink fluids. Ensure infants and children drink adequate amounts of liquids. Avoid drinks containing caffeine; alcohol; or large amounts of sugar because they will actually cause you to lose more fluid. Also; avoid very cold beverages because they can cause stomach cramps. Electric fans may be useful to increase comfort and to draw cool air into your home at night; but do not rely on a fan as your primary cooling device during a heat wave. When the temperature is in the upper 90s or higher; a fan will not prevent heat-related illness. A cool shower or bath is a more effective way to cool off. (See paragraphs below. Check regularly on those at greatest risk of heat-related illness: infants and children up to 4 years of age people 65 years of age or older people who are overweight people who overexert during work or exercise people who are ill or on certain medications Avoid hot foods and heavy meals. Ask your doctor whether medications you take affect your body's response to the heat. Do not leave infants; children or pets unattended in a parked car or other hot environment. Use of Fans for Cooling In order for a fan to be effective; the skin surface must be moist. When the skin surface is moist; moving air removes heat from the skin as the moisture evaporates. Unfortunately; when a person begins to develop heat stroke; they stop sweating. In addition; elderly persons may not sweat due to poor heat regulation messages sent out by their brain centers. If a fan is to be effective; the skin must be moist either with sweat; or with dampened clothing; or with moisture added by rubbing wet cloths over the skin surface. Although fans are less expensive to operate; they may not be effective as indicated above; and may even be harmful; when temperatures are very high. As the air temperature rises; air flow is increasingly ineffective in cooling the body until finally; at temperatures above about 100&#176; F (the exact number varies with the humidity) increasing air movement actually increases heat stress. More specifically; when the temperature of the air rises to about 100&#176; F; the fan may be delivering overheated air to the skin at a rate that exceeds the capacity of the body to get rid of this heat; even with sweating; and the net effect is to add heat rather than to cool the body. The widespread distribution of fans; often practiced in the past as a heat-relief measure; thus appears unlikely to be particularly effective in preventing major heat-related health effects when temperatures are very high. The better alternative by far when the temperature soars is to use an air conditioner if one is available or to seek shelter in an air-conditioned building.,no,"Input: Heat Exhaustion Heat exhaustion is the body&#8217;s response to an excessive loss of the water and salt contained in sweat.

"So i report a damp peeling wall in my passage outside my bathroom...and water in the bathroom. They send me a man who has some wet plaster ready to apply and says; ""plaster"" I tell him he needs to find the leak. He doesn't answer; scrapes away the peeling paint and applies the wet plaster. 2 minutes later the painter walks in and paints over the wet plaster. The foreman then arrived and I asked him how that was going to fix the leak? He pointed to the wall and said; ""NO MORE LEAK"" All I could do at this point was laugh as I couldn't believe how serious he was that the leak was fixed!

Practice a fire drill as often as possible This is a VERY low cost nursery but all this was done ASAP regardless of the cost.

Most of us are expats here in Qatar. We are living under their beautiful culture. As I stayed here for almost a year; I can see that most of them are Family oriented which is I found it amazing. But how come it&#8217;s really hard for those who apply for FAMILY VISA approval / RP? If you don&#8217;t belong to those lucky NATIONALITIES; your application will be rejected for sure. It&#8217;s crappy and racism. I know a lot of who applied for their Family Visa and got rejected. Most of them are earning well. Above 10;000QR basic; when they asked the officer in the Immigration why it was rejected; they can&#8217;t give them a good answer. Maybe they can&#8217;t tell it straight to the point that their nationality is FILIPINO; INDIAN; PAKISTANI or NEPALI etc. They don&#8217;t have choice but to send their kids back to their countries because they can&#8217;t get approval. I pity those kids who needs to be with their parents and have a whole family. Their parent/s should stay here because they need to work. Inshallah; they will change the system here when it comes for applying family visa approval / RP as this is a Family oriented country.

Please find below a letter to Gulf Times Editor written br Mr. Abdul Nasar A. K. and published in today's GT For your comments. _________________________________________________________ LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Winter agony for KG kids Dear Sir; It is heart-rending for parents to awake their KG-going children early in the morning; around 5 o&#8217;clock; for school every day in winter. Every morning I feel extremely guilty when I force my four-year-old daughter to get up at that time so that she can go to school. If our children are genuinely conscious of their rights they would file a lawsuit against their parents to protect them from this type of &#8220;abuse&#8221;! It is a type of torture and cruelty even though our actions are inspired by good intentions and the future well-being of our kids itself. But good intentions cannot always justify actions. Nevertheless; my suggestion to expatriate school managements is to consider changing timing for KG pupils from January to March at least. Classes for the above category now start at the same time as for senior grades and end by 11am. Special buses then take the kids back home. It will not be an additional burden for school managements if they deploy these buses to collect KG students from their houses by 9am and start their classes by 10am. KG classes could end by 1pm as with senior pupils and they can all return home in one bus. I would like to request all parents to come forward with their suggestions. School authorities also can make a survey to know how parents think about this suggestion; if they see it worth considering.

"Another Filipina worker killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait JERRIE M. ABELLA; GMANews.TV 10/24/2010 | 10:55 PM The Philippine Embassy in Kuwait has confirmed that the decomposing body of a woman found over a week ago on the roof of a building in that small; oil-rich Middle Eastern country was that of a Filipina worker. Vice Consul Rea Oreta said; in a phone interview Sunday with GMANews.TV; that the victim was identified based on her passport as Jenny Dechosa; 33; from Misamis Oriental. &#8220;(Kuwait&#8217;s) Criminal Investigation Division (CID) has just confirmed to us that the victim was indeed a Filipina; and her case is now under investigation;"" Oreta said. According to her; the CID likewise told the Embassy that an Egyptian national has been arrested in connection to the crime and is now detained at the Bayan Police Station. Oreta said the CID has refused to release more information on Dechosa&#8217;s case as it is considered &#8220;confidential;"" but reports state the suspect was the victim&#8217;s lover. &#8220;Right now we are requesting the help of the OUMWA (Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Affairs) to locate the family of Dechosa because all we have is her passport;"" Oreta said. Missing since Oct. 10 A report by the Kuwait-based Arab Times said Dechosa&#8217;s body was found by police authorities on October 16 in between air-conditioning units on the roof of Hall No. 5 at the Kuwait International Fair grounds in Mishref. According to the report; Dechosa was working in a saloon in Salmiya and does part-time work as a house cleaner. Quoting Dechosa&#8217;s housemates; the report said the victim left their house on October 10; her rest day; for a part-time cleaning job in Mishref. She; however; reportedly backed out of the job as the house was too big and instead asked the taxi driver to drop her off a shopping mall where she was supposedly meeting someone. Dechosa was unable to go home that day; and six days after she was reported missing; a body of a woman in a state of decomposition was found in Mishref. On the same day; her employer and housemates confirmed that the body was indeed Dechosa&#8217;s through fingerprinting and other pieces of evidence; even as her face was reportedly unrecognizable as it seemed to have been smashed with a hard object; the Arab Times report said. A separate report on Arab Times on Saturday identified the suspect as the Egyptian caretaker of the building where Dechosa&#8217;s body was discovered. The report said the suspect was identified based on the victim&#8217;s mobile phone records. The suspect reportedly confessed he had an affair with Dechosa; and admitted killing her by hitting her with a metal rod on her head. The motive for the killing; however; remains unclear. According to Vice Consul Oreta; Dechosa&#8217;s remains may take at least a month to be repatriated; or as soon as the CID and the local prosecutor finish their investigation. OFW-friendly? The killing of Dechosa came three months after two other Filipinas were brutally killed in separate incidents in Kuwait; which has been identified by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs as one of the countries where the rights and welfare of overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) are protected. In July; a Filipina worker was tortured to death by her employer and then left in the desert; while another was stabbed dead at least 31 times by her Egyptian husband allegedly in a fit of jealousy. Government agencies have likewise repatriated Filipino workers from Kuwait by the hundreds in the last few months; majority of them household service workers who ran away from their sponsors for various reasons; such as labor contract violations and physical abuse; or are overstaying in the country. Oreta declined to comment if Kuwait&#8217;s classification as a safe country for migrant workers will be reviewed in light of the recent string of killings and abuses of Filipino laborers in the Middle East country. Kuwait ranks sixth in the top ten destinations of OFWs in 2009; with some 45;900 Filipino workers deployed there on the same year; according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Records from the Commission on Filipinos Overseas meanwhile show there are over 140;000 Filipinos in Kuwait as of 2008; only 500 of whom are considered permanent residents. &#8211; DM/KBK; GMANews.TV",no,"Input: Another Filipina worker killed in &#8216;OFW-friendly&#8217; Kuwait JERRIE M.

""On September 6; 2007; Israel destroyed the nuclear reactor built by Syria secretly; apparently with North Korea's help;"" then US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice wrote in the cable published in Yediot Aharonot newspaper. ""Our intelligence experts are convinced that the attack targeted by the Israelis is in fact an atomic reactor of the same type built by North Korea in Yongbyon;"" she wrote in the message dated April 2008. ""We have good reason to believe that the reactor was not built for peaceful purposes;"" she said; adding the attack came only weeks before the reactor was to become operational. Rice also noted the secrecy surrounding the construction of the nuclear facility; with the Syrian authorities refusing to invite the International Atomic Energy Agency or any media to inspect the site. Syria has always denied that the structure targeted by Israeli warplanes was a nuclear reactor; although it has admitted it was a ""military site under construction."" Israel has for its part never denied that its air force attacked a target in Syria; without ever officially claiming responsibility for the action. Former US president George W.

And the worst part is that we (Immigrants) can't take any action against the employers here. I was working with a local employer in the hospitality section as IT Manager. I was promised that I will get release/NOC after completing my two years contract with the company. I did completed my contract and found another opportunity with a high package and family benefits. I have two kids; one 11 months old and the other two and half year old; for me the important thing was to look for something that could help me to get the best health and living facilities for my kids; which was offered by the new company. I gave a notice period of 40 days to my company with a written request to get NOC to work in Qatar and my management confirmed in writing that I shall be getting my NOC. The time I completed my 40 days&#8217; notice with a proper handover; the company refused to give me NOC and thus I became jobless. Because I left the company and I cannot join another one; I have nothing to survive. I have bank liabilities taken for my family support; now the bank is asking me to clear the liabilities which I cannot because my ex. employer hasn&#8217;t paid my end of services and still holding my passport and I have no work even to feed my kids so how can I pay the bank. Bank is not allowing me to go out of the country because of the liabilities and my ex. company is not giving me release to work anywhere else in Qatar. If I couldn't pay the bank they can put me in jail that makes me worry because I don&#8217;t know what will happen to my kids. I tried to go the human rights commission here in Qatar but I was strictly informed not to file any complaint or case against the local employer as they will put me and my family in more troubles. I don&#8217;t know what to do. And I don&#8217;t know who I should ask to get help.

Hi everyone! My girlfriend is working in Doha; so she got a residence permit and she's under a working visa. What happened is that she found out some sort of vascular disease which is ruining her legs (and she works at a restaurant). She needs to make an operation as soon as possible!! But she has been working there for 3 or 4 months now and the company says that they cannot do anything for her because she MUST complete at least 7 months working. This operation is expensive in Qatar and if the company doesn't help to pay she cannot do it. So the solution is to quit the job and come back to Turkey. BUUUT for my surprise she said it is impossible because they wouldn't give her the EXIT PERMIT... It sounds extremely absurd and nonsense since it's a health issue and it seems that she is locked in the country and in a job she can no longer do it. Sorry for the long text but I hope you guys can gimme some advices!,no,"Input: Hi everyone! My girlfriend is working in Doha; so she got a residence permit and she's under a working visa.

From Friday's Peninsula: No plans for cap on expat job tenure DOHA: Qatar values its expatriate workforce and has no plans to emulate Saudi Arabia&#8217;s example and pack off long-staying foreign workers. A Saudi Minister last week hinted at his government&#8217;s plans not to renew job visas of expatriate workers after six years. Other GCC countries have occasionally looked at similar policies. &#8220;We categorically rule out any plans to refuse to renew job visas for long-staying expatriate workers;&#8221; the source said. The daily also quoted a number of nationals as saying they were against packing off long-staying and experienced expatriate workers as that would mean a major blow to the Qatari economy. Nearly all key sectors of the economy would be severely affected if expatriate workers are to leave after six years. A national said the worst-affected would be the education sector; for instance; where a majority of teachers are foreigners.,no,"Input: From Friday's Peninsula: No plans for cap on expat job tenure DOHA: Qatar values its expatriate workforce and has no plans to emulate Saudi Arabia&#8217;s example and pack off long-staying foreign workers.

As Ahmed-Dinner-Jacket leaves the Presidency the one thing Iranians know is that he had a position without power. The real power lies with the 12 members of the Religious Council and their leader. They know a dictator when they see one. ---------------- Iran dissident's funeral turns into anti-government protest Tens of thousands have attended the funeral of a senior dissident cleric; in what became Iran's biggest anti-government protest for years. Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri died at the age of 87 on Sunday in Isfahan. He was a vocal opponent of the hardliners in power in Iran and had resigned from his post in protest. Mourners at the funeral chanted slogans against the government and Iran's supreme leader; Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; describing him as a dictator. Protesters also called for the release of all political prisoners; including the two top leaders of the reformist green movement who are under house arrest in Tehran. Ayatollah Taheri was a pro-reformist Friday prayer leader in Isfahan; one of the largest cities in Iran. It is the biggest such protest in Iran in the past few years; and interestingly the police did not intervene; says Kasra Naji of BBC Persian. The authorities are careful not to provoke public anger just 10 days ahead of the presidential elections; observers say.,no,"Input: As Ahmed-Dinner-Jacket leaves the Presidency the one thing Iranians know is that he had a position without power.

Three women die together in an accident And go to heaven. When they get there; St. Peter says; 'We only have one rule here in heaven: Don't step on the ducks!' So they enter heaven; and sure enough; There are ducks all over the place. It is almost impossible not to step on a duck; and although they try their best to avoid them; the first woman accidentally steps on one. Along comes St. Peter with the ugliest man she ever saw. St. Peter chains them together and says; 'Your punishment for stepping on a duck is to spend eternity chained to this ugly man!' The next day; the second woman steps accidentally on a duck and along comes St. Peter; who doesn't miss a thing. With him is another extremely ugly man. He chains them together with the same admonishment as for the first woman. The third woman has observed all this and; not wanting to be chained for all eternity to an ugly man; is very; VERY careful where she steps. She manages to go months without stepping on any ducks; but one day St.Peter comes up to her with the most handsome man she has ever laid eyes on .... Very tall; long eyelashes; muscular.

..An Indian man has ended up in jail in Abu Dhabi &#8211; for kissing his then girlfriend at a party in India seven years ago. A photograph of the kiss has been used by the woman&#8217;s husband - who is divorcing her - to prove an affair between the two. The husband claims that affair was rekindled in the UAE last year; Emirates 24/7 reports. The 30-year-old MBA graduate was sentenced to 18 months in jail by the Court of First Instance in Abu Dhabi. After serving six months; the sentence has been suspended pending an appeal. The man; known as Suhail; met his ex-girlfriend; a Pakistani living in the UK; when she went to Mumbai on holiday. They lost touch when she went back to the UK. But they met up again in Abu Dhabi in 2011 after she relocated there with her husband. Suhail claims he did not have a physical relationship with the woman; did not know she was married and did not even know her real name.

But he never heard back. ""I was disappointed and saddened that India; known for upholding human rights; never got back despite several requests by me for asylum. Indians are also great supporters of WikiLeaks. I therefore contacted the foreign office through the Indian high commissioner. I wrote to them but they never responded;"" Assange said. The WikiLeaks founder said that if a small nation like Ecuador could have the guts to provide him asylum; India which has considerable global standing with a billion-plus population should not be afraid of ""standing up for human rights"" and giving Snowden asylum. ""Ecuadorians showed immense courage and granted me asylum;"" he added. Assange called Snowden a hero for exposing ""the most serious events of the decade"" &#8212; how America was snooping into people's emails; phone calls; messages en masse and across the globe. ""It was because of Snowden that India came to know how US was snooping on them. It is an obligation for India to protect Snowden. Now is the time for India to show it stands up for human rights;"" he said. Assange warned Snowden against serious witch-hunting by the US government. The Australian information activist; who is trying to avoid extradition to face ""trumped up"" charges of sexual offences in Sweden; said he is still willing to take asylum in India if such an offer comes.

It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. What to eat and what to avoid this Ramadan --------------------------------------------------------- Have a light meal: Do not stuff yourself with food and drinks during or between Iftar and Suhoor. This contradicts the spirit of Ramadan and defeats the whole object of fasting. Health problems can emerge as a result of excess food intake which can &#8216;clog&#8217; your digestive system. At Iftar it is advisable to have a very light meal first &#8212; like dates and juices or soup and reserve the main meal for later after the Maghrib prayers perhaps or even after Taraweeh (special night prayers). The body&#8217;s immediate need is to get water and an easily available energy source in the form of glucose for every living cell; particularly the brain. What to eat: Due to the long hours of fasting; we should consume slow digesting foods including fibre-containing foods (which last up to 8 hours) rather than fast-digesting foods (which last for only 3-4 hours). Slow digesting foods contain grains and seeds like barley; wheat; oats; millet; semolina; beans; lentils; whole meal flour; unpolished rice; etc (called complex carbohydrates). Fibre-containing foods are bran; whole wheat; grains and seeds; vegetables like green beans; peas; spinach; the leaves of beetroot (iron-rich); fruit with skin; dried fruit especially dried apricots; and prunes; almonds; etc. Foods to avoid: Anything hot; spicy; hot or salty. Too much salty food will make your body retain water and give you the feeling of being bloated; while spicy foods also induce thirst. Sweets and sugary foods are fast-burning and will only last for 3-4 hours. Moreover; these will turn into fat; increase cholesterol levels and make you gain weight. Fried foods are unhealthy and should be limited. They cause indigestion; heartburn and weight problems. -------------------------------------------------------- What to drink: Drink sufficient water between Iftar and bedtime to avoid dehydration. Drinks with high caffeine content (coffee; tea; chocolate; sodas and even decaffeinated teas and coffees) should be avoided. Caffeine leaches calcium from your system; which means you feel less full all the time. Avoid drinking tea at suhoor (dawn); as tea increases salt excretion in the urine; which is needed for your body during fasting. --------------------------------------------------------- Do not skip Suhoor: Dieticians warn that those who are fasting should not skip the morning meal as this is needed to get you through the day. Many people eat a late night meal and sleep through till the dawn prayers. This is not advisable. Self-discipline: As Ramadan fasting is basically an exercise in self-discipline; for those who are chain smokers; food nibblers or caffeine addicts (coffee; tea; coke; and chocolate); it is a good opportunity to break the habit; hoping that the effect will continue when the month is over. It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings. --------------------------------------------------------- Fasting and weight loss: Fasting is a good way of losing weight; however some people even put on weight during Ramadan. The basic equation is simple &#8211; you must balance the calories that you take in with the calories that go out. If you consistently eat more calories than you burn; you will tend to store up the excess as fat. Exercising will help you maintain your body weight; it will help burn calories and get rid of stress. ---------------------------------------------------------,no,"Input: It is best to start weaning yourself off your daily fixes well before Ramadan to minimise cravings.

here is my situation. On August 29 ; I saw an ad on Qatar living for a apartment to be rented in Al Sadd for 8000 QAR. The ad specifically said no comission. I went to see the apartment ; the current tenant just moved in first of August ; and needs to vacate the premises closer to his job ; and needs to find a replacement tenant to take over the lease. I agreed. Then one day before signing the contract with the LANDLORD ; I receive a call from the current tenant informing me that he paid commission to the person who assisted him in finding the apartment ; and that I need to pay him part of the comssion since he only lived there for a month. I thought bout it ; if i disagree ; he will find another renter. So I said ok . Then I signed the contract with the landlord ; and there is no mention of commission on the contract .

"Pilot makes emergency landing after finding snake in cockpit A pilot in Australia's Northern Territory was forced to turn his plane around after a snake popped out from behind his dashboard and crawled down his leg.

Their seamers are all having very bad economy and why dont they try some new bowlers rather than carrying the players like Vinai Kumar and Yadav.

"Dubai: A police lieutenant colonel; six lieutenants and six officers have been referred to court on charges of using torture and extensive beatings during an interrogation which allegedly led to the death of a Pakistani man and left two others with injuries. Prosecutors levelled a number of charges against the 13 Dubai Police personnel; varying from abuse of power; unlawful detention of the deceased B.K. and his two compatriots; torture; extensive use of force during interrogation; forgery and giving a false statement during official questioning by a public prosecutor. Dubai Police's forensic doctor testified that B.K. died after being badly beaten which left him with acute bleeding in his brain. B.K.'s injured compatriots were identified as S.H.; 38; and M.S.; 33. According to the forensic doctor's prosecution statement; M.S. sustained burns which were caused by a chemical substance used to remove rust. ""There were bruises; cuts and injuries over different parts of his body as well. Due to the severe and extensive beating; M.S. suffered a critical kidney failure. Meanwhile S.H. was beaten by hands and ghutras [head dress cord worn by local men] and kicked;"" the doctor claimed. The 13 suspects; including nine Emiratis; two Pakistanis and two Omanis; are scheduled to appear before the Dubai Court of First Instance on May 31. According to the charges sheet; prosecutors accused the brigadier; four lieutenants and four officers; with unlawfully locking up B.K. in Naif police station. Records said B.K.; M.S. and S.H. were allegedly wanted for an investigation related to a kidnapping case that caused death. Dubai Police Chief Lieutenant General Dahi Khalfan Tamim earlier told Gulf News that if the investigation uncovered negligence or culpability; those involved would have to face the law. An Eritrean ambulance paramedic testified that she and her colleagues were asked to head to Naif police station because there was a problem. ""We were not informed what happened.

Hey; a strange experience folks. When ever you are travelling please check if your RP / Visa is valid at least for a period of 6 months. My RP expires on 16 Nov.2010; while the Immigration counter cleared with their seal; the guy Pravesh of Qatar Airways in the departure lounge never permitted me to board the flight at the last minute. I showed my return flight is within 48 hours; even if he wants me have a longer vacation;I cannot stay away; as I joined my employer 8 months back. I showed my EXIT permit and I am travelling to Muscat just for 2 days for a family commitment. As per GCC regulations the Visa is stamped for 2 years and RP renewed every year; I don't know how the Visa was also stamped for one year in my case. He took me to his Supervisor another Kid of 24; 25 years ; I mentioned I have lived in the GCC for 24 years and I would not jeopardise my job nor their job; but the guy went on blabbering 'I don't want to lose my job' again and again. I pity the plight of these youngsters; who would not understand practicality - while my stay in the airport for 2 hours such chaos and passengers speaking high tone and getting away for excess baggage and what not; I politely asked me to show me the counter for processing the refund and walked home with disappointment; afterall a week end trip to Muscat and back was futile. Please check the RP well before you plan your trip; just a caution so that you do not face the same disappointment; specially if it is a annual vacation.

"Qatar has grown and developed so quickly and massively in the last few years. Its economy; government and people are forces to be reckoned with; locally and in the international arena. There is innovation; imagination and enthusiasm to be found in all aspects of Qatari society as well as in the expat community that calls Qatar its home. There is also much respect for the leaders of this tiny up-and-coming business center. They have demonstrated vision for the development of the country and a concern for their countrymen by educating them and putting them to work to continue the building of their own country. Qatar has been described as a country which ""champion(s) the cause of freedom"". (The Peninsula; Oct 11; 2010). Meanwhile; Qatar has also invited hundreds of thousands of workers&#8212;skilled and unskilled&#8212;to lend a hand in the building of Qatar. While some of these workers succeed in tucking away tidy nest eggs and returning to their own countries better off; there are others who struggle to realize their earnings or even a decent standard of living while they are here. Much of a worker's fate depends on the benevolence; or lack thereof; of his sponsor&#8212;his salary; living conditions and dismissal&#8212;so much so that the sponsorship system has been compared to modern-day slavery. Some countries have realized that the sponsorship system for workers is outdated; antiquated and unfair to workers. Perhaps those same countries have already realized benefits of having more satisfied foreign workers. Bahrain has done away with the sponsorship structure and Kuwait is scheduled to retire it in February 2011. In keeping with its vision and progressive thinking; Qatar needs to do away with the sponsorship scheme that it has been using up to now. Rather than feeling fearful of allowing workers and employers to move freely between companies without the 2 year penalty; both parties can be relieved of the misery of feeling stuck with an unhappy partner. Employees who aspire to better themselves or look for new challenges can find new opportunities and can take advantage of them; contributing their skills and expertise in a competitive atmosphere; rather than feeling stifled and abused by an archaic system. An important segment of the present working population; namely educated; skilled professionals; will inevitably start feeling resentment towards sponsors who refuse to release them to pursue other opportunities. While seemingly in control of people's fates; Qatar will eventually start losing real talent to other countries; especially to those countries that have eased or will ease the unfair restrictions that make up the sponsorship regulations. Qatar will end up losing talented; knowledgeable professionals because of a stubborn refusal to give up that relatively small amount of control&#8212;a control that is not a fundamental right for employers or sponsors to begin with. From an Islamic perspective; it is wrong for one person to have such control over another; man is free and should not be a slave to another. Islam has clear guidelines and parameters; one need only consult a scholar for ahadith and Qur'anic verses that would present support for an end to the practice of sponsorship in its current form. With a competitive system; employers would be forced into better treatment of their workers in order to retain their valued staff. The result will be a more contented workforce and better products; both of which are beneficial for the employer. The resistance to a change in the present legislation could only be construed as a worrisome fear that employers would actually have to provide things for their employees that; heretofore; they have been able to overlook; i.e.; proper living situations; salaries paid on time and in full; and the choice by an employee to stay or leave for a different position. No one wins when an undervalued employee is retained against his will. If Qatar is the new &#8220;land of opportunity&#8221; for expats; it is also still the land of perceived slave owners who are unwilling to give up their grasp on the chains that bind their employees and keep them subservient. That grasp enables sponsors to keep their workers tied to them&#8212;but only until the employees have outlived their usefulness. There is no dignity to be found in an environment such as this. Slavery goes against human dignity and is also against the spirit of Islam. Qatar needs to fulfill its role as a leader in the region by setting a new standard&#8212;a standard of human rights that was established by Islam.

Sergio Ramos and Xabi Alonso both picked up second yellow cards for time-wasting in the late stages of the club's 4-0 win at Ajax. That means they will miss the last group G game against Auxerre; but the match is irrelevant as Real have already qualified as winners.

"Two-year-old Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes were among the 13 children killed in the fire which broke out in the Villaggio Mall in Doha. The grandfather of the triplets killed in a blaze at a daycare centre in a Doha shopping mall says he struggles to see how he will ever be happy again. The fire ripped through the Gympanzee childcare centre in the Villaggio (correct) mall in the capital Doha at 11.30 am (8 pm NZT); killing 19 people and injuring 17. New Zealand-born triplets Lillie; Jackson and Willsher Weekes; aged two; were among those killed in the fire. They were the only children of expats Jane and Martin Weekes. The grandfather of the triplets; Ron Turner; told Newstalk ZB he and his wife would be travelling to Doha tonight to be with their daughter and son-in-law. They had been contacted by Ms Weekes just after the babies had been found and were told they had died of smoke inhalation. ""She was still just as numb I suppose; and just as empty as my wife and I feel right now and the rest of our family and friends who have rallied around to give us support. "" The triplets had been going to the day-care three mornings a week for the past couple of months; Mr Turner said. ""That gave them an opportunity to meet more children and be involved in a different environment than home and mum and dad and nannies; and they were so proud to show off their school bags.'' The triplets' bodies would be brought back to New Zealand; he said. Just last week Ms Weekes wrote on babycenter.com of potty training the trio. ""We have about 7 potties around our living space (it's a really big open plan area and is tiled so we have no issues with accidents) and in the bathroom to be able to sit one on the toilet with a kiddy seat and 1 or 2 on the potties if it turned into rush.'' New Zealand journalist Tarek Bazley; who lives 1km from the mall in Doha; was in another part of the mall with his children when the fire broke out. ""The first thing I heard of it was a very benign fire alarm; it sounded more like a doorbell to be honest; repeating in the background;'' he told Radio New Zealand. After 15 minutes he asked an attendant whether he should be worried; but was told to ""sit tight'' and that it was usually a false alarm. ""About 10 minutes later; someone else; a member of the public; raced through this area and said; `Everybody out; you've got to get out now. The other half of the mall is on fire.' That is what he said to me.'' ""I believe the problem was that once the fire took in the area near the nursery; there was no way to actually escape.'' Both exits were blocked by smoke; he said. The alarm and sprinkler system appeared to have malfunctioned. ""It's an extraordinary mall in the sense that as you walk down it it has this ceiling that is like a mock sky; so I think in order to achieve that effect; they've actually not put in sprinklers in this area.'' Fire-fighters had to break through the roof to get to trapped children after a staircase to the first-floor nursery collapsed; an official said. Dense smoke inside the mall; combined with the fierce temperature from the flames; made reaching the trapped children very difficult; a representative of the civil defence told a news conference. Prime Minister John Key this morning said New Zealand Foreign Affairs staff were travelling to Doha from Saudi Arabia to provide support for the Weekes' family. ""Their family are obviously dealing with the terrible grief that they have at this time. Obviously it's a very tragic day for that family.'' Labour leader David Shearer also sent his condolences to the family. ""I join with all other New Zealanders in expressing my heartfelt sympathies to the parents; extended family; and friends; of the three young children caught up in such a tragic event.

""About 10 minutes later; someone else; a member of the public; raced through this area and said; `Everybody out; you've got to get out now. The other half of the mall is on fire.' That is what he said to me.'' ""I believe the problem was that once the fire took in the area near the nursery; there was no way to actually escape.'' Both exits were blocked by smoke; he said. The alarm and sprinkler system appeared to have malfunctioned. ""It's an extraordinary mall in the sense that as you walk down it it has this ceiling that is like a mock sky; so I think in order to achieve that effect; they've actually not put in sprinklers in this area.'' Fire-fighters had to break through the roof to get to trapped children after a staircase to the first-floor nursery collapsed; an official said. Dense smoke inside the mall; combined with the fierce temperature from the flames; made reaching the trapped children very difficult; a representative of the civil defence told a news conference. Prime Minister John Key this morning said New Zealand Foreign Affairs staff were travelling to Doha from Saudi Arabia to provide support for the Weekes' family. ""Their family are obviously dealing with the terrible grief that they have at this time. Obviously it's a very tragic day for that family.'' Labour leader David Shearer also sent his condolences to the family. ""I join with all other New Zealanders in expressing my heartfelt sympathies to the parents; extended family; and friends; of the three young children caught up in such a tragic event. The pain of their loss is unimaginable. Answer: no

I'm writing the following just warn all QL readers to be careful with their belongings; especially NOT TO LEAVE ANYTHING of value outside your homes on the porch or in your backyards or inside the cars. My road bike was stolen on 24th of December 2011; from right outside my house garage in the early morning hours. The Bike was parked and locked outside our house garage. So I never believed that it will be robbed in Qatar; because we live in a compound with security grads controlled gates and everything. .. However it happened. And From my observations and the way that the scum carried out their robbery; I&#8217;m pretty much convinced that; whoever stole the bike; they must have been watching and surveilling the house and the bike for a while; and must have had someone from inside the compound ( probably the grads) helping covering up for them while they carried out the robbery. Don't let this happen to you too. In the unfortunate case that it does happen to you; and if the garage was not broken in; go to Capital Police immediately.

First-year students at Veterinary school were attending their first Anatomy class; with a real dead animal. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a White sheet. The professor started the class by telling them; 'In Veterinary Medicine it is necessary to have two important qualities as a Doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the Animal body'. For an example; the Professor pulled back the sheet; touched his finger in the mouth of the dead animal; withdrew it and put his Finger in his mouth. 'Go ahead and do the same thing;' he told his students. The students freaked out; hesitated for several minutes. But eventually took turns putting their finger in the mouth of the dead pig and tasted in their mouth. When everyone finished; the Professor looked at them and said; 'The Second most important quality is observation. I touched with my middle Finger and tasted on my index finger.

DOHA: Long criticised for non-existent enforcement of anti-smoking law; Qatar&#8217;s public health authorities have swung into action and handed out fines to some 829 people so far this year for lighting up in public places. And the fines the health inspectors collected from the violators totalled an impressive QR319;000 &#8212; which means that on average a smoker caught paid QR385 in fine. The places raided by the inspectors included popular hangouts like the City Centre; The Mall; Villaggio; Hyatt Plaza; Landmark and Royal Plaza; among others. Interestingly; the health inspectors didn&#8217;t spare government offices; including ministry buildings; and raided them as well and caught violators. Responsible for ensuring a smoke-free Qatar; the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) said in a release yesterday that inspectors from its anti-tobacco unit conducted 1;330 raids between January and mid-November this year at public places where smoking is banned. The SCH has reiterated in its release it would intensify monitoring and conduct more raids; especially as many violators were caught in shops located closer to schools. The SCH campaign assumes significance as it comes ahead of a law that is reported to be on the anvil; and; which many expect; could see the mushrooming &#8216;sheesha&#8217; joints; especially in residential localities and near schools; close down. During the latest anti-tobacco campaign of the SCH; however; what is surprising is that no &#8216;sheesha&#8217; outlet has been raided by its inspectors and no fines have been handed out to users to &#8216;sheesha&#8217; addicts; who; understandably; also include an increasing number of women and children. The current anti-tobacco law is described by anti-smoking activists as weak and lacking teeth as the punitive measures provided for are not deterring enough. Official figures suggest that some 16 percent of the Qatari population is addicted to smoking; and that includes &#8216;sheesha&#8217; as well. School students aren&#8217;t immune. A survey has recently been conducted by public health authorities to determine the extent to which smoking is prevalent in schools. Its findings are expected to help the SCH come up with ways that are effective enough in fighting this menace among youngsters. The authorities have recently made it mandatory for cigarette packets being sold in the local market to carry graphic images of deadly ailments smoking can cause; but its impact on the prevalence of smoking in the country is yet to be assessed. Some youngsters; instead of kicking the habit; have begun buying small steel &#8212; and sometimes silver &#8212; boxes so they could shift the cigarettes from what is a repulsive looking pack to a fancy case.

"ABU DHABI -- The Ministry of Interior yesterday withdrew the ""six-month ban"" system imposed by the Immigration and Residency authorities on various categories of workers upon the cancellation of expatriates' employment visa. The decision; that will have a major impact and implications on the UAE labour market; has come into force with immediate effect. The Naturalisation and Residency Departments stopped stamping the ban on passports while processing cancellation of employment visas. Ahmed Al Hamadi; in-charge of Passport Office at the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs; said: ""We received a letter from the Immigration and Residency Department with instructions from Interior Minister Lt-Gen. Shaikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan not to stamp the ban on applications for cancelling visas. The decision was put into effect yesterday when we cancelled employment visas without imposing the ban."" He said the office received hundreds of applications yesterday; which were processed without slapping the six-month ban. For employers; it will now be easier to hire talents from within the country. For the millions of expats working in various capacities; barring maids; the news should come as manna from heaven; for there would now be free movement of workforce in the country. Employers can get the best talent available in the market without the hassle of seeking the ""No Objection Certificate"" from the current sponsor. Ministry sources told Khaleej Times that under instructions from Lt.-Gen. Shaikh Saif; the ministry circulated the decree among all Immigration and Residency Departments in the country; and that the decision came into effect yesterday. On the categories included in the decree; the official said only housemaids were excluded for the time being; and that a special committee would be set up to study their case. ""Housemaids were not included in the decision. A special panel will be formed to study the possibilities of exempting this category also from the ban;"" said the official. He said the decision was in line with Cabinet Decree No. 18 of 2005 on sponsorship transfer of employees in the private sector; under which a fee of Dh1;500 for masters and doctorate holders; Dh3;000 for bachelors degree holders and Dh5;000 for certificates lower than bachelors degree would be levied. A special panel comprising senior officials had been set up in February to look into various aspects of streamlining the residence and labour market laws. Hitherto; only those who met the requisite conditions for sponsorship transfer; including consent of sponsor; completion of one-year in a company and a valid residence visa; among others; were eligible to change jobs within the country without getting their passports stamped with the six-month ban. In practice; however; movement of labour force was virtually impossible with hardly any sponsor willing to write out a no objection certificate. Meanwhile; most employees and employers who were processing their applications at the ministry yesterday; seemed overwhelmed by the decision and welcomed the measure which they said was bound to improve labour relations.

It will spare employees the hassles they face with employers.""Abdul Jalil Rahma; owner of Noon Contracting and Construction Company; said : ""The ban was never in favour of employees.

"From Ifancy To Adulthood: From the moment we are born we are barraged by manipulation; conditioning; and pressure to become the image of what is around us.

It's easy to see; just take a look at the relationship between the current fad and children or teens.

An greybeard man was hearing his words. Their conversation goes like that. Greybeard Man : Hi Stop please don&#8217;t do that. Young Man : Ohh no Why should I stop. What is life all about . I don&#8217;t have anything to live so its better to die than live with nothing. Greybeard Man : Ok Man. I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your eyes. Young Man : No way I cant live see without my eyes. Greybeard Man : Ok I will give you 10;000 bucks if you gimme your kidneys. Young Man : Ohh no I cant live without my kidneys. Greybeard Man then repeated all the important parts of his body and asked him to sell them for money but the man was continuously denying to do that. Then the greybeard man told the young man that just in your body you are having things which worth millions but still you are ungrateful. Be happy with what you have and do hard work and live your life.&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221; Hence sometimes we just don&#8217;t realize/utilize what we have and just blame others. Sometimes we just see the container and don&#8217;t really understand what really contains in it. So it is better to start every day with a goal to push forward to be a good being.

"Hello to all the people here in Qatarliving!..May I ask if someone could give us the best suggestion regarding our problem with my family visa? Our problem is; my husband is currently working here in a government sector and on ""Definite Contract"" for 2 years with a bachelor status in the company;in short; he is not entitled to get family visa for me unless the contract will not yet renewed and change to family.Because of his eagerness to get a family visa for me; i came here for a family visit and applied for family visa in the immigration andwe are very happy that it was already approved and I had my medical and finger printing..When we went to immigration to apply for an RP the lady told us to go the captain to have my form signed if we are going to shoulder the payment for the visa;unfortunately the captain didn't sign my application form but rather asked for a letter from the company..We are very worried because we understand that the company will not give us a letter to the immigration because my husband is not yet entitled of the family status.. Please give us some advise on what we are going to do; the lady on the counter told me that it is possible to get an RP without the letter but it is the decession of the captain...",no,"Input: Hello to all the people here in Qatarliving!..May I ask if someone could give us the best suggestion regarding our problem with my family visa?

After that; you'd better know something. - That it's not what happens to people that's important. It's what they do about it. - That you can do something in an instant that will give you heartache for life. - That you should always leave loved ones with loving words.

Same goes for true love. - That maturity has more to do with what types of experiences you've had and what you've learned from them and less to do with how many years you've lived. - That you should never tell a child their dreams are unlikely or outlandish. Few things are more humiliating; and what a tragedy it would be if they believed you. - That no matter how good a friend is; they're going to hurt you every once in a while and you must forgive them for that. - That it isn't always enough to be forgiven by others.

It could change your life forever. - That no matter how you try to protect your children; they will eventually get hurt and you will hurt in the process. - That there are many ways of falling and staying in love. - That your life can be changed in a matter of hours by people who don't even know you. - That even when you think you have no more to give; when a friend cries out to you; you will find the strength to help. - That writing; as well as talking; can ease emotional pains. - That credentials on the wall do not make you a decent human being. - That the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon.

And right now he has about Qr8000. So we didn't have a choice but to stay 6mos maximum (we're leaving next week). After 3 mos i will be coming back (Inshallah) so i can work (visit visa again) and hopefully we can get our son by combined salary.It will really be a big sacrifice leaving my son..but not for long though.

Two men; both seriously ill; occupied the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was next to the room's only window. The other man had to spend all his time flat on his back. The men talked for hours on end. They spoke of their wives and families; their homes; their jobs; their involvement in the military service; where they had been on vacation.. Every afternoon; when the man in the bed by the window could sit up; he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one hour periods where his world would be broadened and enlivened by all the activity and colour of the world outside. The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake.Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every colour and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details; the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene. One warm afternoon; the man by the window described a parade passing by. Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days; weeks and months passed. One morning; the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window; who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate; the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch; and after making sure he was comfortable; she left him alone. Slowly; painfully; he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside. He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed. It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window. The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall. She said; 'Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you.' Epilogue: There is tremendous happiness in making others happy; despite our own situations. Shared grief is half the sorrow; but happiness when shared; is doubled.

I just needed to let you all know that there is a shocking hair dresser at Medical Spa. She is Tunisian and unfortunately she is also the Manager... so my complaints never reached the owner (the manager just hangs up the phone whenever I call to discuss the matter). I asked her for subtle highlights for my wedding and she did the worst highlights ever. They started over an inch from my scalp; so I looked like I had regrowth before even stepping out of the salon! She gave me bright bleached stripes... not at all the subtle blended highlights that I asked for. Further; she spent the entire time gossiping about the other members of staff; which was not pleasant to hear - totally unprofessional. She is an absolute shocker and I do not recommend any one go there. I used to go there a lot; but having dealt with that impossible woman; I just can't stomach spending any money to assist in making the business successful. I do not recommend going there... Buyer Beware!!,no,"Input: I just needed to let you all know that there is a shocking hair dresser at Medical Spa.

"This story is about a beautiful; expensively dressed lady who complained to her psychiatrist that she felt that her whole life was empty; it had no meaning. So; the lady went to visit a counselor to seek out happiness. The counselor called over the old lady who cleaned the office floors. The counselor then said to the rich lady""I'm going to ask Mary here to tell you how she found happiness. All I want you to do is listen to her."" So the old lady put down her broom and sat on a chair and told her story: ""Well; my husband died of malaria and three months later my only son was killed by a car. I had nobody... I had nothing left. I couldn't sleep; I couldn't eat;I never smiled at anyone; I even thought of taking my own life. Then one evening a little kitten followed me home from work. Somehow I felt sorry for that kitten. It was cold outside; so I decided to let the kitten in. I got it some milk; and the kitten licked the plate clean. Then it purred and rubbed against my leg and for the first time in months; I smiled.

There were 173 passengers on board the two flights.

"How to Maintain a Healthy Level of Insanity in the Workplace 1) Page yourself over the intercom. Don't disguise your voice. 2) Find out where your boss shops and buy exactly the same outfits.

""That's a good point; Sparky."" ""No; I'm sorry; but I'm going to have to disagree with you there; Cha-cha."" 4) Send e-mail to the rest of the company telling them exactly what you're doing. For example: ""If anyone needs me; I'll be in the bathroom."" 5) Hi-Lite your shoes. Tell people you haven't lost them as much since you did this. 6) Hang mosquito netting around your cubicle. When you emerge to get coffee or a printout or whatever; slap yourself randomly the whole way. 7) Put a chair facing a printer. Sit there all day and tell people you're waiting for your document. 8) Every time someone asks you to do something; anything; ask them if they want fries with that. 9) Encourage your colleagues to join you in a little synchronized chair-dancing. 10) Put your trash can on your desk. Label it ""IN."" 11) Feign an unnatural and hysterical fear of staplers. 12) Send e-mail messages saying there's free pizza or donuts or cake in the lunch room.

"A man was sick and tired of goingto work every day while his wife stayed home. He wanted her to see what he went through so he prayed: ""Dear Lord: I go to work every day and put in 8 hours while my wife merely stays at home.

You never ever judged me; You understood my sorrow. Then you told me it needn't be that way And gave me the hope of a better tomorrow. You were always there for me; I knew I could count on you. You gave me advice and encouragement Whenever I didn't know what to do. You helped me learn to love myself You made life seem so good. You said I can do anything I put my mind to And suddenly I knew I could. There were times when we didn't see eye to eye And there were days when both of us cried. But even so we made it through: Our friendship hasn't yet died. Circumstances have pulled us apart; We are separated by many miles. Truly; the only thing that keeps me going Is my treasured memory of your smile. This friendship we share Is so precious to me; I hope it grows and flourishes And lasts unto infinity.

Dear Ql friends; My husband had applied for my resident visa which was rejected and then he was told to come for committee interview in madinat khalifa. one day before the meeting he got a call saying that the meeting will not be in madinat khalifa but we have to go to mesaimeer centre and meet Captain ABC between 7 am to 7 30 am. We (My husband and me)arrived at the mesaimeer centre at 6:45 am. tried to meet Captain ABC in his office on first floor and one of the service staff guided us to the reception(since he was busy in another meeting). They said to wait outside counter no XX. My husband kept waiting outside the counter in line while the guard let all local people go in first and told us we can go after they are over with work. After waiting for two hours in the women's waiting area ;I decided to look for the Captain in his office again while my husband still waiting in queue outside counter. Luckily this time i met the captain and explained what i was there for. He said we were late and i had to explain him for a while that we were waiting outside the counter on ground floor. He then asked me to call my husband to his office .He then took us to a room for a video conferencing with a senior person while three other captains were in the room. The interview lasted for 2 mins in which they just asked my husband about his salary and how he was today :) The captain then said check status after three days. Its difficult to wait and i hope such a short interview doesnt mean that our application is rejected. P:S I know I wrote a long note but we dont want anybody else to go through the same problem. Incase you are called for interview to meet certain captain at mesaimeer centre; Please do not wait at the counter; but directly go and look for the captains room on the first floor. Otherwise you will be late and you def dont want to upset the captain. hoping for a positive response for the visa :/,no,"Input: Dear Ql friends; My husband had applied for my resident visa which was rejected and then he was told to come for committee interview in madinat khalifa. one day before the meeting he got a call saying that the meeting will not be in madinat khalifa but we have to go to mesaimeer centre and meet Captain ABC between 7 am to 7 30 am.

Before I came here in Qatar I'd thought that it will be a good start to build up my dreams but when I was here it suddenly changed. I came here in Doha with tourist visa expecting that I can easily find a job. My girlfriend help me to process the papers because she was already 6 months in here. Going here is easy but being here starts my headache. To make the story short my girlfriend got a visa from illegal person and make money on us. In my 1 month tourist visa I found a job that at first I thought it would be a good starting point. I was hired as a sales executive on one of Filipino magazine here in DOHA(quite comfortable at first because I am a Filipino). They have a lot of promises that nothing was been made. They said they will provide transport; gave phone allowance and most of all fix my visa that is already expired. In my 3 month in that company no promises was been made; I don't have my transport; no phone allowance; very delayed salary and the worst is they didn't fixed my visa T_T which started me to worry because of the penalty I'm going to pay. I keep on reminding them and begging to fix my visa which quite helpful because they told me that I will undergo medical and fingerprint. So I've done medical and fingerprint; but on the 4th month on my job another problem happened. The sponsor just told me that I was fired because one of my workmate which get his passport in the office w/o asking permission to our sponsor and never come back to work. Our sponsor got mad and I'm the one he blame for what my workmate did. So everything going to be harsh in Qatar. I've work on that company for 6 months and in my last 2 months of being there I didn't got my salary. They released me from that company because the sponsor and the management got problem on finance. First I thought that it will be a good opportunity to look for another job but it makes me wrong. Mostly the company is looking for transferable visa. I pay my flat rent my food and no work until now. My visa is 6 months and I need more month to be transferable....

They said they will provide transport; gave phone allowance and most of all fix my visa that is already expired. In my 3 month in that company no promises was been made; I don't have my transport; no phone allowance; very delayed salary and the worst is they didn't fixed my visa T_T which started me to worry because of the penalty I'm going to pay. I keep on reminding them and begging to fix my visa which quite helpful because they told me that I will undergo medical and fingerprint. So I've done medical and fingerprint; but on the 4th month on my job another problem happened. The sponsor just told me that I was fired because one of my workmate which get his passport in the office w/o asking permission to our sponsor and never come back to work. Our sponsor got mad and I'm the one he blame for what my workmate did. So everything going to be harsh in Qatar. I've work on that company for 6 months and in my last 2 months of being there I didn't got my salary. They released me from that company because the sponsor and the management got problem on finance. First I thought that it will be a good opportunity to look for another job but it makes me wrong. Mostly the company is looking for transferable visa. I pay my flat rent my food and no work until now. My visa is 6 months and I need more month to be transferable.... My agony continues day by day thinking how to pay my bills and survive in this dessert land. Answer: no

"TOKYO (Reuters Life!) - A Japanese lingerie maker Wednesday unveiled a bra that carries messages of encouragement from overseas as the country struggles to recover from a devastating quake and tsunami that struck exactly two months ago. The white; bustier-style garment and matching skirt by Triumph are covered with messages from 36 different countries received in the aftermath of the disaster; each accompanied by a tiny flag of the nation that sent it. Messages ranged from simple good wishes; such as ""Japan; with you 100%"" from France; to expressions of admiration for Japan's strength and dignity. Others were poignant. ""Those who have already left us let us know life is so fragile; and those who are alive let us know life is so strong;"" said one from China. The company; known for its concept designs; said it came up with the bra after receiving messages of support from branch companies around the world; along with relief supplies. The bra is not for sale. ""I read each message myself; and I realized that everyone around the world is sending their support;"" said 20-year-old Hikaru Kawai; who modeled the outfit. ""So I decided that I needed to do my best as well."" Nearly 26;000 people were killed or are unaccounted for after the disaster; which triggered the world's biggest nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986 -- and which a few messages couldn't resist alluding to. ""Our thoughts are with you! Future without nuclear power; for our children!"" read a message from Greece. Previous efforts from the company have included a solar-powered bra and a ""Welcome to Japan"" bra; which featured greetings in three different languages.

If you&#8217;re thinking of buying a new Kia car then think again! I have recently bought one in fact I have just taken it for its first (1000km) service. The car had a problem with the door handle and needed replacing. They said they had fixed it with lubrication but needless to say as soon as I inspected it; it was still the same! It took a stand up row with the supervisor at AL_ATTIYA Motors (Industrial area) to get him to order the part so that the door handle could be replaced (it still has not been replaced). ALSO...I left just under a &#188; tank of fuel in the car. When I picked the car up the following day; the fuel tank was TOTALLY empty with the display showing that I had 0 km to go before the tank was dry! There were no extra km on the odometer so the car must have been left &#8216;ticking over&#8217; for HOURS on end to exhaust the fuel. The car manual specifically says that the engine should not be left idling for longer than 3 minutes before 2000km!!! You would think that the &#8216;mechanics&#8217; would know this. I was worried about taking the car because I was concerned that I would run out of fuel....the supervisor seemed unconcerned and offered no explanation. Luckily my wife was with me in her car and we did make it to the nearest garage...which took us out of our way home!!

I see a lot of topics here on QL from time to time.It makes an interesting read from time to time but some of the comments which have a very negative shade give me a bad headache at times.Below are my points on this: 1.Qatar is my new home so it is for most of you. 2. Before coming here I did a small exercise to make up my mind about what to expect and what not to expect. I think all of us should do that so that we are not surprised. 3.Comparison of Qatar with your hometown is not justified.It's a newly developed country. 4. This is the place where we all have come due to our own personal interests and hence we are not in a position to complain too much. 5.We should all try and do soething about things that we feel are wrong and try and improve it instead of just being a pessimist. 6.Writing disparaging things about the country on QL can get you into trouble if you cross the lines of decency.You never know who is reading your post and if that person happends to be of someone of authority;you might have to repent.

Doctor raped woman; court told September 29; 2010 04:37:59 PMA+ A-| || An Australian doctor allegedly raped a woman seven times in one night; a jury has been told. The Victoria woman claimed that Arvind Sharma raped her feigned and that she had passed out after he allegedly attacked her in an attempt to stop his actions; a Victorian County Court jury heard. Sharma pleaded not guilty to seven counts of rape and three of indecent assault arising from the alleged incident in December 2006 at his Bendigo home. He claims the sex was consensual. Opening the Crown case; prosecutor Jim Bessell told the jury of 10 men and two women that Sharma and the complainant were known to each other and had previously had sex. He said the woman had told Sharma she felt unwell after drinking a Midori and lemonade while they were nightclubbing with friends. They had argued about returning to his house. After lying on his bed; the woman again argued with Sharma and rolled away from him; wanting to go to sleep; Mr Bessell said. He said that the woman felt Sharma's hands on her side and he began rubbing her side: ''She knew this action suggested he indicated interest in having sex'' but she declined his advances; Mr Bessell said. The alleged attack on the woman began when she was close to sleep; the prosecutor said; but she stayed still ''as though passed out; in the hope that he would think she was out of it and he would stop''. The woman was raped seven times and indecently assaulted three times; Mr Bessell told the jury; saying that Sharma had been ''rough'' with her. Before the pair went out; the woman had dropped an overnight bag off; intending to stay the night; Mr Bessell said. After Sharma fell asleep following the alleged incident; she text messaged a friend; who took her to the police station. Defence counsel Rodney Willcox said while both Sharma and the woman had been drinking; both were aware of what was going on. He said Sharma did not undress the woman against her will; but both had undressed themselves. ''The defence say there was no rape and indeed; there was no indecent assault;'' Mr Willcox told the jury. ''She did not at any stage object from the alleged incidents. She did not voice her concern; she didn't leave the house at any stage during; or immediately after; the alleged incident. ''She was aware and she was alert and she pretended to be asleep.'' Mr Bessell said the woman could recall seeing the flash of Sharma's mobile phone camera while he was allegedly assaulting her; even though her eyes were closed.

I am new on QL and have noticed that its quite popular among residents of Qatar. I would like to remind people to please drive carefully on the roads and follow traffic rules. Its really shocking to see that people have no respect for fellow drivers; even for cars with babies/ children in them! I was almost hit this morning by a reckless driver driving on 80kmph on a small road in residential area; who did not look at the STOP sign stuck on his side of the road and just drove zipping past me. I drive with my baby (5 months old) in his car-seat; so I don't drive in a high speed and stick to the speed limit allowed for roads; which is why he missed hitting me. Had I been in the same speed as him; he would have hit my car really hard. I expect people to respect the 'Baby on board' sign that is stuck on cars. I was so angry with this driver and would have followed his car to slap him really hard; had my baby not been with me in the car. I just wanted to vent out my anger thats why I'm posting it here and I'm sure there are many of you that have experienced this situation before.

I can't imagine taking it; hyphenating it; or subjecting my children to it. ___Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion. ___The fact that our first dining experience to date has left MY wallet a little lighter; and YOUR pants a little tighter! ___Your inadvertent admission that you ""buy condoms by the truckload"" indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my personality. ___You failed the 20 Question Rule; i.e.; I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself. ___Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants; then you can't GET into my pants. ___You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess. ___You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you. ___You have a hairy back. ___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing. ___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable. ___The phrase ""My Mother"" has popped up far too often in conversation. ___Although I do enjoy the X-Files; I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting. ___Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker. ___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long term partner. ___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should; however; happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches; please resubmit your application. ___Somehow I doubt those condoms that I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip. ___I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time.

So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors; please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition: (Check those that apply) ___Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it; hyphenating it; or subjecting my children to it. ___Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion. ___The fact that our first dining experience to date has left MY wallet a little lighter; and YOUR pants a little tighter! ___Your inadvertent admission that you ""buy condoms by the truckload"" indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my personality. ___You failed the 20 Question Rule; i.e.; I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself. ___Your legs are skinnier than mine. If you can FIT into my pants; then you can't GET into my pants. ___You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess. ___You're too tall. I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you. ___You have a hairy back. ___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing. ___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable. ___The phrase ""My Mother"" has popped up far too often in conversation. ___Although I do enjoy the X-Files; I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting. ___Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker. ___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long term partner. ___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should; however; happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches; please resubmit your application. ___Somehow I doubt those condoms that I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip. ___I am out of your league; set your sights lower next time. Sincerely; _________________________________ Answer: no
